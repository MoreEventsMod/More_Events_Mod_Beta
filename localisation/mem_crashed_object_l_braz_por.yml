 mem_crashed_object.11.name:0 "Alien Sounds"
 mem_crashed_object.11.desc:0 "Upon closer inspection, the crashed object on the surface of the asteroid turned out to be an alien probe! Along with rudimentary solar collection and radio reception and transmission technology, the probe also contains a flat, grooved disc mounted on the side. Spinning the disk elicits a deluge of sounds. [Root.GetLeaderName] believes it to be an alien form of music!\n\nUnfortunately, this music isn't very good, or perhaps it is geared towards audio sensory equipment vastly dissimilar to our own. Still, a cultural artefact from a completely different species... that's something, right?"
 mem_crashed_object.11.a:0 "It's not that bad..."
 
 mem_crashed_object.12.name:0 "Escape Pod"
 mem_crashed_object.12.desc:0 "An expedition sent to explore the wreck on the surface of the asteroid brought back an interesting find. It appears to be an emergency craft, judging by the lack of substantive propulsion systems, on board of which several pods capable of sustained cryogenic suspension were found. Most had been dismantled to service a single, jury-rigged pod, containing one occupant. Although the system strained to keep them alive, by our best estimations the cryogenic system failed over five hundred years ago. Little can be determined from the creature's desiccated remains, with stellar radiation having sterilized most of its tissues.\n\nAll's not lost, however, as the pure inventive genius of the improvised system has aided our knowledge of long-term system maintainability and cryogenics."

 mem_crashed_object.13.desc:0 "Our initial scan appears to have been a false positive. The metallic debris detected from orbit was merely the glimmer of exposed metal ore."
 mem_crashed_object.13.a:0 "You can never have too many minerals, I suppose."
