 mem_demon_ship_category:0 "Strange Readings"
 mem_demon_ship_category_desc:0 "First survey scans show abnormal readings emanating from the outer atmosphere of §Y[Root.GetName]§!. The science team is eager to do a second, more accurate scan of the planet to better determine the source of these readings."
 MEM_DEMON_SHIP_PROJECT:0 "Stabilize Prototype Orbit"
 MEM_DEMON_SHIP_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientists are confident that by docking a science ship to our prototype we will be able to correct and stabilize its orbit. This involves lengthy calculations and accurate maneuvering. They'll spare you the details, but they do underline the fact that the time window for a successful operation of this caliber is limited."
 mem_demon_ship.103.desc:0 "Our science team was not able to identify what caused the strange readings. We may never know whether it was just a sensor malfunction or if there was ever anything there at all."
 mem_demon_ship.1.name:0 "Lost Prototype Ship Discovered"
 mem_demon_ship.1.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is ecstatic. After more thorough scans, the anomaly turns out to be a spaceship. Intriguingly, it is one of ours. Our crew recognizes it as one of our prototype FTL-capable ships thought to be lost on a testflight years ago.\n\nIts orbit is unstable and the ship is slowly descending into the atmosphere. It seems to be undamaged, but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing attempts.\n\nIn order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew, its orbit has to be stabilized first. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has already come up with a plan."
 mem_demon_ship.1.a:0 "Save this piece of our history."
 mem_demon_ship.1.b:0 "Who cares about some old ship?"
 mem_demon_ship.2.name:0 "Orbit Stabilized"
 mem_demon_ship.2.desc:0 "Although tt turned out to be a bit trickier than Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! had originally anticipated, the operation was a success and the prototype is now in a stable orbit, ready to be examined more closely. §Y[Root.GetName]§! is commencing docking procedures."
 mem_demon_ship.2.a:0 "Keep me informed."
 mem_demon_ship.3.name:0 "Prototype Lost"
 mem_demon_ship.3.desc:0 "We were not able to stabilize the orbit of the FTL-Prototype before it sank into the atmosphere of the gas giant and was destroyed."
 mem_demon_ship.4.name:0 "Urgent Message"
 mem_demon_ship.4.desc:0 "An urgent message has arrived from Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!: The crew is dead, their mutilated corpses floating through the depressurized sections of the ship. As there is no decay in vacuum, our science team can only guess at the age of the corpses.\n\nThe lack of habitable atmosphere aboard the ship remains a mystery, as the ship's hull appears mostly intact. The ship seems to have run out of energy a while ago. It will take some time before we will know more."
 mem_demon_ship.4.a:0 "How horrible."
 mem_demon_ship.5.name:0 "Grim Discoveries"
 mem_demon_ship.5.desc:0 "Further investigations revealed that all of the ship's energy cells were exhausted at some point in the past. Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! replaced several of the depleted fuel cells with reserve cells from the §Y[Root.GetName]§! in an attempt to bring auxillary power back online at the least.\n\nThe logbook shows the crew joking in joyful anticipation of their first FTL-flight. Immediately following the activation of the ship's FTL engines, however, all records went dark. It is hard to assess how much time passed before the recordings started again. The most recent entry following the blackout describes a completed testflight and a complete shift in the ship's atmosphere. Those same faces smiling a moment ago are now distorted by pain, their screams echoing as they mutilate themselves. The recording ends abruptly.\n\nShall we investigate further or leave the dead to rest?"
 mem_demon_ship.5.a:0 "Destroy the ship. No one must know what was found."
 mem_demon_ship.5.b:0 "We must know what caused this tragedy."
 mem_demon_ship.6.name:0 "FTL-Prototype Destroyed"
 mem_demon_ship.6.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! undocks from the FTL-prototype and pushes it into a descending orbit again. Shortly afterward it is consumed by the fires of atmospheric entry."
 mem_demon_ship.6.a:0 "May they find peace."
 mem_demon_ship.7.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship.7.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the FTL-event, Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew to madness.\n\nWhile reviewing further data, a feeling of a dark presence overcame our Science Officer and [root.leader.GetHerHis] assistants. The science team promptly removed the datacore, returning with it to the §Y[Root.GetName]§!.\n\nUpon returning to our vessel, the science team monitored an energy spike inside the prototype's FTL-core. Emergency undocking procedures were initiated and were completed just before the prototype ship seemingly vanished into the void. Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been altered by strange dimensional energies, currently undocumented by our scientists.\n\nMight it be alive? We may never know, but the datacore our science team retrieved provides a significant amount of data on faster-than-light travel."
 mem_demon_ship.7.a:0 "Our knowledge expands!"
 mem_demon_ship.8.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship.8.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the FTL-event, Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew to madness.\n\nWhile reviewing further data, [root.leader.GetSheHe] [root.leader.GetWasWere] was interrupted by the noise of the crew fighting and screaming. One of the Science Officer's assistants had seemingly gone mad, attempting to destroy the §Y[Root.GetName]§! while shouting incoherently about how the prototype \"demanded\" more passengers to the \"Other Side\". With no shortage of luck and at the cost of some injuries, the rest of the team managed to confine him aboard the [Root.GetName].\n\nAfter this event, [Root.GetLeaderName] chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have brought with it from this "Other Side" by remotely using the ship's self-destruct device. We may never know what exactly happened to the ship and its crew, but our science team is alive and our chief scientist's colleague is on the way to recovery."

The severe mental stress must have driven the crew to madness.\n\nOur final transmission between the §Y[Root.GetName]§! and mission control was a single video recording, wherein Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! stands in front of the camera holding [root.leader.GetHerHis] own eyes in [root.leader.GetHerHis] hands while speaking in a low, distorted voice: \"We go now to the Other Side.\" The science team's agonizing screams echo through the transmission before ending abruptly.\n\nRecovery teams searching for our science ship have found no trace of the vessel..."

 mem_demon_ship.20.a:0 "Prepare an investigation."

#  "The Return"
#  "One of our sensor stations near [mem_demon_ship_position.GetName] received a distress signal today. According to the forwarded data its source is the §yFar Horizon§!, which has been listed as missing decades ago. The signal was accompanied by an audio stream of a voice chanting in an archaic [root.GetAdj] dialect. Through comparing archived samples of all personel involved in the ship's disappearance the voice was identified as belonging to the missing chief scientist [mem_demon_ship_scientist.GetName]. "
