 mem_space_race.1.name:0 "Space Race"
 mem_space_race.1.desc:0 "An unusual idea has been proposed by some in our empire. In the interest of galactic peace and cultural and technological exchange, they propose to organize a new galactic sporting event. \n\nThe "Space Race" will comprise of a series of competitions to identify the most skilled pilots and engineers in the galaxy. The proposed format involves having small piloted crafts race each other across complex tracks through our space."
 mem_space_race.1.a:0 "Excellent idea! Send out invitations."
 mem_space_race.1.b:0 "No, it's a bad idea."
 
 mem_space_race.2.name:0 "Invitation to a Space Race"
 mem_space_race.2.desc:0 "Greetings, [root.GetSpeciesName]. We are organizing a galactic sporting event, a Space Race, through which we hope to identify the most skilled pilots and engineers in the galaxy. We are inviting every major nation - including, of course, yourselves - to participate. Would you like to come?"
 mem_space_race.2.a:0 "What a grand idea. Of course we will come."
 mem_space_race.2.b:0 "We'd rather not."
 mem_space_race.2.b.psycho:0 "Are you serious?!"
 mem_space_race.2.b.inwards:0 "We have no interest in your affairs."
 mem_space_race_must_be_diplomatic:0 "We are not interested in xeno diplomacy."
 
 mem_space_race.4.name:0 "The Race is a Go"
 mem_space_race.4.desc:0 "Enough foreign empires have expressed the desire to participate in our grand new Space Race. We should begin the preparations."
 mem_space_race.4.a:0 "I can barely wait."
 
 mem_space_race.5.name:0 "Space Race Cancelled"
 mem_space_race.5.desc:0 "We could not find enough countries willing to participate in the proposed Space Race to make it worth the effort. The event had to be called off."
 mem_space_race.5.a:0 "Most disappointing."
 
 mem_space_race.6.name:0 "Preparations for the Race"
 mem_space_race.6.desc:0 "The Space Race is drawing closer and closer. Every participating nation is working hard to prepare its race crafts and pilots for the event. Our engineers are hard at work to provide our pilots with every advantage they can.\n\nThe race will be a showcase of the best technology the [Root.GetName] and other empires can offer. However, the rules of the race limit the size of the craft, forcing us to choose which system we prioritise. Should we try and press our biggest technological advantage or compensate for our shortcomings? Or simply give everything equal priority and hope that our overall technological clout carries the day?"

 mem_space_race.6.a:0 "Give everything equal attention."
 mem_space_race.6.b:0 "Focus on shields."
 mem_space_race.6.c:0 "Focus on thrust."
 mem_space_race.6.d:0 "Focus on armour."
 
 mem_space_race.7.name:0 "Our Participation in the Space Race is Cancelled"
 mem_space_race.7.desc:0 "Because of the war we are currently fighting, we will not be able to dedicate the resources to outfitting a team to participate in the space race we signed up for."

 mem_space_race.8.name:0 "The Space Race Will Start Soon"
 mem_space_race.8.desc:0 "Final preparations are being completed as our empire prepares to host the most exciting sporting event in the galaxy. Soon, the greatest pilots and engineers from known space will come to showcase their skills."
 mem_space_race.8.a:0 "This is so exciting."
 
 mem_space_race.10.name:0 "Elimination from the Space Race"
 mem_space_race.10.desc.shield:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race took place in the proximity of the star, forcing pilots to rely on their shields to avoid dangerous solar winds and heat. \n\nUnfortunately, our craft was not able to take the heat and was therefore forced to keep its distance from the star, losing precious time on its longer trajectory. It didn't make it to the finish line in time, and has been eliminated."
 mem_space_race.10.desc.thrust:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race involved a long and complex trajectory around many different planets and other massive celestial bodies. \n\nIt seems our craft's engines were not powerful enough to manoeuvre effectively within strong gravity wells, causing it to lose precious time. It didn't make it to the finish line in time, and has been eliminated."
 mem_space_race.10.desc.armor:0 "The most recent round of the [From.GetAdj] Space Race took participants through a thick cloud of space debris, forcing them to rely on their crafts' armour to avoid being disabled by collisions. \n\nOur craft braved the obstacle course for some time, but its hull was unable to take the punishment, and eventually it was damaged to such an extreme that it had to withdraw."
 mem_space_race.10.a:0 "Disappointing."
 
 mem_space_race.11.name:0 "Third Place in the Space Race" 
 mem_space_race.11.desc.shield:0 "$mem_space_race.10.desc.shield$ \n\nBeing eliminated from the race at this stage places us third in overall scoring. This isn't victory, but we made it to the pedestal."
