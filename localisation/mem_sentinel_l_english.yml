 mem_sentinel_dig_site: "Dead and Buried"
 mem_sentinel_dig_site_desc: "A massive ship is detected on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], mostly buried under tons of sand and dust. Its design is unlike anything we saw before. \n\nNo signs of life or energy signatures are dected on site, but ship itself appears to be mostly intact."

 mem_sentinel.1.name: "Point of Entry"
 mem_sentinel.1.desc: "We have finally managed to make our way inside the ship - by digging through sand and right into the hole in the hull. The compartment §Y[Leader.GetName]§! found herself in appears to be a shuttle hangar, breached from outside by a small contigengent of soldiers. \n\nSeveral bodies found scattered in hangar appears to belong to a rebel faction in the §YColgari Empire§! - a star nation that existed several hundreds of years ago in this region in space. The rebels apparently refused to recognize authority of the emperor Jorath, whom they believe to be an illegitimate clone impersonating the real deseased emperor and carried out a mission to board his personal flagship - §SFirst Sentinel§! - in attempt to capture or assassinate him. \n\nIn this room they have engaged the contingent of loyalist marines and emerged victorious, establishing a foothold."
 mem_sentinel.2.name: "Central Control Hub"
 mem_sentinel.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] managed to breached another room of interest. \n\nThis one appears to be a computer hub housing an AI core as well as other control terminal. Data from the terminals confirms that this ship is indeed the §SFirst Sentinel§! and emperor Jorath was aboard at the time of the attack, travelling across the empire to gather support. \n\nAfter the attack, the crew attempted to activate the automatic defence systems, most of which were controlled by on-board AI directly, but something went wrong: for some reason android soldiers could not differentiate the crew and the boarders and attacked both indiscriminately. \n\nJudging by the current state of the room, the crew managed to retake the hub and used explosives to disable the AI with extreme prejudice."
 mem_sentinel.3.name: "The Grand Hall"
 mem_sentinel.3.desc: "We have located a massive compartment occupying several decks in the middle of the ship. \n\nThis one appares to be a reception hall of some sort where emperor would be able to host receptions and partake in other activities. \n\nJudging by the bodies on the floor and overturned furniture, this was the room where rebels, ship's security crew and the security robots all engaged each other in a massive firefight. It is difficult to say who won this one, since all three sides suffered heavy losses in progress."
 mem_sentinel.4.name: "The Emperor's Quarters"
 mem_sentinel.4.desc: "Deep within the interior compartments of the ship we found fortified quarters reserved for emperor himself. \n\nThe luxurious compartment was shielded from weapon fire, radiation and other environmental factors, contained its own life support system and was stocked with luxurious items and delicacies to last for years. \n\n§Y[Leader.GetName]§! believes that the remains in the room belong to emperor Jorath himself and six his most trusted advisors or courtiers. The cause of their deaths seems ot be of all things iodine poisoning. \n\nIodine had intoxicating effect on Colgari physiology, inducing euophoria in small doses, but causing systemic organ failure in large quantities. The concentration in the mummified tissues appears to be 10 times greater than lethal. It is unclear if this was an accident, suicide or murder."
 mem_sentinel.5.name: "The Fallen Sentinel"
 mem_sentinel.5.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports finally successfully locating the bridge of the ship. The damage to the systems of the birdge are minimal; and the events that transpired aboard and led to its demise are much clearer. \n\nTurns out it wasn't fighting or AI uprising that doomed the ship, but an engine malfunction. A minor defect in plasma flow control system in one of the thrusters would've been easily fixed otherwise, but with crew otherwise occupied with fighting and damage control in the interior and AI systems take offline, there was nobody to monitor it. \n\nAs one of the conduits burst open, the ship was flooded with massive amount of radiation killing everyone outside of specifically shielded Emperor's quarters. Without anyone to steer it, the dormant ship drifted for a very long time through space until it was captured by the gravity of [From.Planet.GetName] and crashed on the surface. \n\nDespite all, the ship is actually still spaceworthy, and with the minor repairs can be made operational again to serve in our navy."
 mem_sentinel.5.a: "Repair the ship."
 mem_sentinel.5.a.tooltip: "Battleship §YFirst Sentinel§! will become a part of our navy."
 mem_sentinel.5.b: "Scrap it. The ship is nothing but bad luck."
