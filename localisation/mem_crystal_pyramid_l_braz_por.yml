 mem_crystal_pyramid_category_desc:0 "At night on [From.GetName], a massive glowing light can be seen beneath the planet's transparent surface, kilometres across in size. Whatever the source of this light is, it must be capable of producing its own energy as it is separated from the surface by over a kilometre of ice."
 
 mem_crystal_pyramid.1.name:0 "Crystal Pyramid"
 mem_crystal_pyramid.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName]'s team has discovered a vast and perfectly smooth pyramid that is emanating the dazzling, colour-changing light on [From.GetName]. Despite finding the source, the team is unable to determine how the pyramid got there, how it is creating the light, and how long it has remained there. They are requesting funding for a special project to drill through the ice and directly access the pyramid."

 MEM_CRYSTAL_PYRAMID_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our Science teams working on [crystal_pyramid_planet.GetName] are requesting additional personnel to find out more about this crystal pyramid."
 
 mem_crystal_pyramid.2.name:0 "Sudden Discharge"
 mem_crystal_pyramid.2.desc:0 "As if responding to [Root.GetLeaderName]'s efforts, the light underneath the ice sheets of [From.GetName] suddenly glowed brighter than ever, before suddenly disappearing. A massive pyramid shaped cavity was found in the ice where the light originated from, implying whatever was once there suddenly ceased to exist. Whatever the reason behind its disappearance, the [Root.GetName] managed to collect a treasure trove of data and energy from the brief and sudden discharge."
 mem_crystal_pyramid.2.a:0 "Well, stranger things have happened."
 
 mem_crystal_pyramid.3.name:0 "Stranger Things"
 mem_crystal_pyramid.3.desc:0 "After reaching the pyramid underneath [crystal_pyramid_planet.GetName]'s surface, [Root.GetLeaderName] has issued a report on the device's nature. It is made of a material unlike anything our team has ever seen and resisted all attempts to even slightly damage its surface. There appears to be no pattern to the waves emitted by the pyramid, yet their high energy on varying wavelengths is proving to be a great source of data for our scientists. While there is no end to the philosophical debates created by the strange object, the only real value appears to be studying it further."
 mem_crystal_pyramid.3.a:0 "Some things are simply beyond our current understanding."
 
 mem_crystal_pyramid.4.name:0 "Crystal Kinship"
 mem_crystal_pyramid.4.desc:0 "The moment the mining team led by [Root.GetLeaderName] reached the pyramid, it glowed in a brilliant shade of red. Against [Root.GetLeaderName]'s hurried orders, one of the miners placed his clutching appendage upon the pyramid - at which point it suddenly disappeared. To their dismay, a group of crystalline entities appeared in orbit around the planet just moments after the pyramid had vanished."
 mem_crystal_pyramid.4.a:0 "That can't be good."
