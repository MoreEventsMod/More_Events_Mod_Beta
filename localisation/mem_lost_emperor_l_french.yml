 mem_lost_emperor.606.name:0 "Findings: Azran's Capabilities"
 mem_lost_emperor.606.desc:0 "Our military theorists have analysed our battle with Azran, and are able to present the following findings:\n\n- Azran relies solely on energy weapons. The chief of these are a barrage of what seems to be energy torpedoes and plasma blasts, but disrupters were also used, and the probe seems to dispose of a strong set of point defence weapons.\n\n- Azran's shields are formidable. However, analysis of our shots that reached through these shields suggests that, although the probe's hull can probably take significant punishment, it does not appear to be equipped with any classical armour plating.\n\nThey suggest that Azran possesses the equivalent of 40-60,000 military power on the scale we currently use to measure fleet strength."
