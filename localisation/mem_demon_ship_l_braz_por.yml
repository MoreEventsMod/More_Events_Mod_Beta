 mem_demon_ship_category:0 "Strange Readings"
 mem_demon_ship_category_desc:0 "First survey scans show abnormal readings from the outer atmosphere of §Y[Root.GetName]§!. The science team is eager to do a second and more accurate scan of the source of these readings."
 MEM_DEMON_SHIP_PROJECT:0 "Stabilize Prototype Orbit"
 MEM_DEMON_SHIP_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientists are confident that by docking a science ship to our prototype we will be able to correct and stabilize its orbit. This involves lengthy calculations and accurate maneuvering. They spare you the details... but underline the fact that the time window for a successful operation is limited."
 mem_demon_ship.103.desc:0 "Our science team was not able to identify what caused the strange readings. We may never know whether there was anything at all or if it was just a sensor malfunction."
 mem_demon_ship.1.name:0 "Lost Prototype Ship Discovered"
 mem_demon_ship.1.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is ecstatic. After more thorough scans, the anomaly turns out to be a spaceship. Intriguingly, it is one of ours. Our crew recognizes it as one of our prototype FTL-capable ships thought to be lost on a testflight years ago.\n\nIts orbit is unstable and the ship is slowly descending into the atmosphere. It seems to be undamaged, but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing.\n\nIn order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew, its orbit has to be stabilized first. [Root.GetLeaderName] has already come up with a plan."
 mem_demon_ship.1.a:0 "Save this piece of our history."
 mem_demon_ship.1.b:0 "Who cares about some old ship?"
 mem_demon_ship.2.name:0 "Orbit Stabilized"
 mem_demon_ship.2.desc:0 "It turned out to be a bit more tricky than anticipated by §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, but the prototype is now in a stable orbit and ready to be examined more closely. §Y[Root.GetName]§! is commencing docking."
 mem_demon_ship.2.a:0 "Keep me informed."
 mem_demon_ship.3.name:0 "Prototype Lost"
 mem_demon_ship.3.desc:0 "We were not able to stabilize the orbit of the FTL-Prototype before it sank into the atmosphere of the gas giant and was destroyed."
 mem_demon_ship.4.name:0 "Urgent Message"
 mem_demon_ship.4.desc:0 "An urgent message has arrived from Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!: The crew is dead, their mutilated corpses floating through the depressurized sections of the ship. As there is no decay in vacuum, [root.leader.GetSheHe] can only guess for how long they have been dead.\n\nIt remains a mystery for now why there is no atmosphere, as the ship's hull appears intact. The ship seems to have run out of energy a while ago. It will take some time before we will know more."
 mem_demon_ship.4.a:0 "How horrible."
 mem_demon_ship.5.name:0 "Grim Discoveries"
 mem_demon_ship.5.desc:0 "All energy cells were exhausted, so some of them had to be replaced with reserve cells from the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to get at least some of the ships systems online.\n\nThe logbook shows the crew joking in joyful anticipation of their first FTL-flight, but then all recordings broke up shortly after the ship's FTL-engines were activated. It is hard to assess how much time passed before the recordings started again. The flight seems to be over and the atmosphere has changed completely. Those same faces smiling a moment ago are now distorted by pain and screams echo as they mutilate themselves. The recording ends abruptly.\n\nShall we investigate further or leave the dead to rest?"
 mem_demon_ship.5.a:0 "Destroy the ship. No one must know what was found."
 mem_demon_ship.5.b:0 "We must know what caused this tragedy."
 mem_demon_ship.6.name:0 "FTL-Prototype Destroyed"
 mem_demon_ship.6.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! undocks from the FTL-prototype and pushes it into a descending orbit again. Shortly afterward it is consumed by the fires of atmospheric entry."
 mem_demon_ship.6.a:0 "May they find peace."
 mem_demon_ship.7.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship.7.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the FTL-event, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew to madness.\n\nWhile reviewing further data, a feeling of a dark presence overcomes the science officer and [root.leader.GetHisHer] assistants. They quickly remove the datacore to take it with them to the §Y[Root.GetName]§!.\n\nRight after returning to their ship, our science team monitors an energy spike inside the prototypes FTL-core. They initiate emergency undocking procedures, which they barely manage to complete before the ship vanishes into the void. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been changed by strange dimensional energies.\n\nMight it be alive? We may never know, but the retrieved datacore provides significant data on FTL-travel."
 mem_demon_ship.7.a:0 "Our knowledge expands!"
 mem_demon_ship.8.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship.8.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the FTL-event, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew to madness.\n\nWhile reviewing further data, [root.leader.GetSheHe] [root.leader.GetWasWere] interrupted by the noise of the crew fighting and screaming. One of the scientist's assistants had seemingly gone mad, and was trying to destroy the §Y[Root.GetName]§! while shouting incoherently about how the prototype demanded more passengers to the "Other Side". With no shortage of luck and at the cost of some injuries, the rest of the team managed to confine him aboard the scienceship.\n\nAfter this event, [Root.GetLeaderName] chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have brought with it from this "Other Side" by remotely using the ship's self-destruct device. We might never know what exactly happened to the ship and its crew, but our science team is alive and the chief scientist's colleague is on the way to recovery."
 mem_demon_ship.8.a:0 "Tragedy averted."
 mem_demon_ship.9.name:0 "Final Transmission"
 mem_demon_ship.9.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the FTL-event, our science team came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew to madness.\n\nThe transmission of science data changes into a video transmission at the end. The chief scientist stands in front of the camera holding [root.leader.GetHisHer] own eyes in [root.leader.GetHisHer] hands while speaking in a low voice: "We go now to the Other Side". The science team's agonizing screams echo through the transmission before it ends.\n\nRecovery teams searching for our science ship found no traces..."
 mem_demon_ship.9.a:0 "Horrifying."
 mem_demon_ship.9.a.tooltip:0 "Our survey ship and its crew are lost"
