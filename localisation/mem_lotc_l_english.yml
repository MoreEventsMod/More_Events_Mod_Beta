 #EVENTS
 
 mem_lotc.1.name:0 "Trafficking operation"
 mem_lotc.1.desc:0 "After exploring the complex extensively, our science team had made an amazing discovery. The data cores appears to be mostly wiped or eroded, but we established that complex belonged to a civilization unfamiliar to us, that went by name Carcharorion. Apparently, they operated several thousands of years ago in this sector of the galaxy. \n\nSomething else however is much more unusual. Lower level is densely packed with large number of stasis pods containing... bodies of our own species. Many of them are still wearing advanced shackles or have crude implants inside their nervous system. It seems, those Carcharorion had abducted some of our primitive ancestors and subjected them to some kind of experiments, before for reason unknown they've chosen to simply kill them by cutting the power supply to stasis pods leaving inmates to suffocate. \n\nWe are picking elevated radiation level from the walls and equipment inside the complex. The power core seems to be either sabotaged and suffered a leak in the past, but now we can not be sure. Residue data extracted from the data cores also contained several sets of coordinates."
 mem_lotc.1a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 mem_lotc.2.name:0 "Underwater facility"
 mem_lotc.2.desc:0 "Submerged beneath the water, our science team had uncovered the ruins of some kind of habitat. Oddly, it appears to be wholesale produced from spaceship components. [Leader.GetName] estimates that several hundreds individuals lived here until it was hit by orbital bombardment. Most of the equipment had been damaged by salt water but our science team managed to recover a fragment of navigational data, that can be useful in proper context. Oddly, both the complex and projectiles recovered on site used the same design."
 mem_lotc.2a:0 "A civil war?"
 
 mem_lotc.3.name:0 "[From.GetName] system"
 mem_lotc.3.desc:0 "We are detecting a lonely ship orbiting a gas giant. It seems badly weathered but is clearly still operational. We should approach with caution."
 
 mem_lotc.4.name:0 "The Hub"
 mem_lotc.4.desc:0 "Several Carcharorion vessels seems to be welded together and placed on stable orbit around [FromFrom.GetName]. As our science team made their way in, they found nothing but decay and abandonment. Most of the life support and other vital systems were dismantled, however the team had found an isolated holosuite they've managed to briefly power up with their ship's systems. In doing so, they found themselves on a surface of a strange world, staring at the unfamiliar sky. They managed to record stars in the sky before the suite burnt out permanently, which, if accurate, could allow us to narrow down location of the planet recreated."
 mem_lotc.4a:0 "Could it be their homeworld?"
 
 mem_lotc.5.name:0 "The Memorial"
 mem_lotc.5.desc:0 "Unfortunately, we were too late by a few centuries. The remains of the complex are still recognizable at the edges of an impact crater, but most of it was obliterated by a meteorite strike. What survived, however, was very interesting. A handful of large rock slabs were still covered of pictogram from which looks of Carcharorion can be identified. A surviving data core [Leader.GetName] had found also contains references to their home system. With additional data to fill the gap, it could lead us straight to it."
 mem_lotc.5a:0 "We'll look into it."
 
 mem_lotc.7.name:0 "The ship had been disabled"
 mem_lotc.7.desc:0 "Now that the Carcharorion cruiser is disabled, we should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.7a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.8.name:0 "The ship had been disabled"
 mem_lotc.8.desc:0 "Someone else had disabled the Carcharorion cruiser and left it to drift aimlessly. We should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.8a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.9.name:0 "[From.GetName] system"
 mem_lotc.9.desc:0 "We are detecting a disabled Carcharorion ship drifting aimlessly. We should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.9a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.10.name:0 "Boarding successful"
 mem_lotc.10.desc:0 "As our forces boarded the ship, they were greeted with a gruesome sight. Bodies of multiple species, who by all means should be dead, stumbled around, attempting to defend the ship. Some of them were even our own species! \n\nIt appears, they are still propelled by extensive neural implanting, that kept them going even after death. Fighting all the way through, boarding party had made their way to the ship's bridge. Some data from flight computers was still usable, and among other things, it indicated that the ship's faster-than-light technology had experiencing major problems, the kind of which we had eliminated before we even left our home system. \n\nTampering with ship's systems appears to have triggered some kind of self-destruction sequence, causing ship to vaporise moments after our boarding crew returned."
 mem_lotc.10a:0 "Disturbing."
 
 mem_lotc.11.name:0 "The Carcharorion home system"
 mem_lotc.11.desc:0 "With data we collected, we can identify presumed home system the mysterious Carcharorion. We should explore it to find out what happened to them and what connection they had with our species."
 mem_lotc.11a:0 "Onward, to answers!"
 
 mem_lotc.12.name:0 "Carchar system"
 mem_lotc.12.desc:0 "We had located Carchar - the presumed home system of the Carcharorion. We are not detecting traffic in the system indicative of a spacefaring civilization so it falls to us to search their planets for answers. \n\nWith information we already gathered, we have no need to perform a basic survey. However, there are many points of interest we should examine closer."
 mem_lotc.12a:0 "Proceed."
 
 
 mem_lotc.13.name:0 "Gwyliwr"
 mem_lotc.13.desc:0 "Dense, poisonous atmosphere of greenhouse gases does not look promising for us, but Carcharorion appear to have different opinion. Several large lighter-than-atmosphere vessels are still floating in the upper atmosphere, each appears to be a habitat for at least a thousand citizens. Several of them were damaged by shots from orbit, but judging by low intensity, those were stray shots. \n\nScience team had found habitat areas to void of any personal possessions and no bodies were recovered, suggesting population at some point abandoned this place off their own accord."
 mem_lotc.13a:0 "Where did they go?"
 
 mem_lotc.14.name:0 "Crau"
 mem_lotc.14.desc:0 "Traces of battle are littering the planet and with large number of debris still drifting in its orbit. It's not clear what actually happened here due to extensive damage sustained by the crafts but [Leader.GetName]'s projections suggested that several major shipyards were established on the planet's orbit using minerals mined from the surface for production. It was likely a valuable military target, which explains the massive battle over it."
 mem_lotc.14a:0 "Interesting."
 
 mem_lotc.15.name:0 "Aelwyd"
 mem_lotc.15.desc:0 "Two major features are apparent when observing the frozen planet: massive ruined arcologies dotting its surface and even more more massive impact craters. The concentration of the craters over the single largest landmass suggests that they were deliberately dropped on the planet's surface. It seems it has already undergoing the small ice age, with impact winter further solidifying the process. \n\nThe damage to arcologies, meanwhile, extend way beyond ravages of time. Many of them bear massive breaches, with profile similar to mass-driver round. Insides of each structure is filled with dead bodies of species identified as Carcharorion. \n\nOne of the arcologies, however, seems to be spared the direct hits. Multiple corpses are still found there, victims of famine and cold, but they appear to be all deliberately moved and stored at the lower level. It is likely someone moved the bodies there before vacating the arcology."
 mem_lotc.15a:0 "Who could've done it?"
 mem_lotc_terraforming_candidate_tooltip_1:0 "§Y[terraforming_candidate_1.GetName]§! will be able to be terraformed once the £society  §H$tech_climate_restoration$§! technology has been researched."
 
 mem_lotc.16.name:0 "Chwaer"
 mem_lotc.16.desc:0 "The moon's surface appears to house several arcologies and underground tunnels connecting them. Debris from large number of warships are dotting the surface of the planets and structures on the surface are perforated by the powerful weaponry. Carcharorion corpses are found through the structure, likely killed by exposure to vacuum from breached walls and shortage of supplies. Some even appear to have died by self-inflicted gunshots. \n\nScience team also found mass graves outside, with bodies simply dumped into trenches and bulldozed over."
 mem_lotc.16a:0 "War never changes."
 
 mem_lotc.17.name:0 "Ofannu"
 mem_lotc.17.desc:0 "Multiple biodomes are covering the planet's surface, every one of them is in ruins. Science team had identified trances of major planetary bombardment targeting the population centres. Judging by some surviving equipment found, locals were working on major terraforming project when their society was wiped out by some hostile force."
 mem_lotc.17a:0 "How did this happen?"
 mem_lotc_terraforming_candidate_tooltip_2:0 "§Y[terraforming_candidate_2.GetName]§! will be able to be terraformed once the £society  §H$tech_climate_restoration$§! technology has been researched."
 
 mem_lotc.18.name:0 "Morthwyl"
 mem_lotc.18.desc:0 "A few ruined radar stations and a small amount of debris are scattered across this moon. It seems to be housing a naval station, likely to protect its primary. Evidently, it came under an attack but it's impossible to say who won."
 mem_lotc.18a:0 "Interesting."
 
 mem_lotc.19.name:0 "Farchnad"
 mem_lotc.19.desc:0 "The asteroid appears to have been hollowed out and made into a major habitat and a supply hub for asteroid mining operation. It is also spinning unusually fast, presumably accelerated to artificial produce gravity for its inhabitants. Large number of dead bodies are found inside. \n\nScience team had managed to recover several digital manifests published across the station, indicating that it was greatly affected by supply line disruption on the onset of war. It seems undersupplied life support system had finally failed at some point turning the whole asteroid into a mass grave."
 mem_lotc.19a:0 "Interesting."
 
 mem_lotc.21.name:0 "Marchog"
 mem_lotc.21.desc:0 "Several outposts appears to have once been present on this planet, now leaving behind only ruins. They were mining ice and various minerals, presumably to supply the rest of the system. All of them were taken out with precision orbital strikes at some point, leaving behind only ruins."
 mem_lotc.21a:0 "Curious."
 
 mem_lotc.22.name:0 "Caer"
 mem_lotc.22.desc:0 "Science team had located an abandoned complex that appears to serve as a Carcharorion prison at some point. Its cells however appears to be mostly empty, suggesting either mass evacuation of inmates or complex operating under capacity. Another noteworthy element on the surface was the bodies of the security many of whom have apparently died of self-inflicted wounds. Lower levels revealed something different - bodies of the prisoners who were outfitted with neural implants of a sort. [Leader.GetName] suggests that those were likely used to control the most dangerous inmates and make them docile."
 mem_lotc.22a:0 "They were experimenting with neural implants? Interesting."
 mem_lotc.22b:0 "This technology is an abomination."
 mem_lotc.22c:0 "Neural implants? We should look into it."
 
 mem_lotc.23.name:0 "Anghenfil"
 mem_lotc.23.desc:0 "A massive battle apparently took place here with countless ships destroyed. Massive clouds of debris are now orbiting the planet drifting aimlessly through the void. [Leader.GetName] reports that he was able to recover several flight computers. They are damaged, but not beyond repair. With more familiarity with the Carcharorion data can be extracted from them."
 mem_lotc.23a:0 "What were they fighting for?"
 
 mem_lotc.24.name:0 "Dolennu"
 mem_lotc.24.desc:0 "Our science team had found a research complex hidden on the moon's surface. It is mostly intact but appears to be scrapped of most valuables, including the data cores. However, some data cores were recovered and they are noted for having two distinct sets of entries on them. First of them contains references to a proof of alien activity in the system and some interesting research data. It mostly pertain to faster-than-light technology, but is crude and at times, almost deliberately wrong. \n\nSecond set appears to be created by the strike team sent to secure results of previous author's study. After gaining control of the facility, they note sudden loss contact with their command. [Leader.GetName] had found the body of the strike team in the base's mess hall, apparently dead by self-inflicted wounds."
 mem_lotc.24a:0 "What were they studying?"
 
 mem_lotc.25.name:0 "Erlid"
 mem_lotc.25.desc:0 "Our science team had came across a hidden facility. Its personnel appears to have been massacred and its systems wiped, however [Leader.GetName] managed to track down several hidden caches. Those are mostly anti-homeworld propaganda aimed at miners on the outskirts of the system as well as some tactical data that allowed us some insight into Carcharorion fleet operations."
 mem_lotc.25a:0 "What were they trying to achieve?"
 
 mem_lotc.26.name:0 "Furiau"
 mem_lotc.26.desc:0 "Positioned in orbit of the planet, our team had found a shipyard, with an unfinished ship still in its clamps. The stasis technology aboard the ship as well as some other elements allows to identify it as a colony ship, however some major oddities in its design are apparent. Designed to operate in space for years without any supply and lacking any faster-than-light technology, it appears to be designed to travel at sublight speed. \n\nStasis pods show traces of freezing and defreezing but no bodies, as if they were already occupied before those inside were extracted."
 mem_lotc.26a:0 "Were they really trying to get around at sublight speed?"
 
 mem_lotc.27.name:0 "Some secrets are better kept buried"
 mem_lotc.27.desc:0 "Several fleets are entering the system from parts unknown. They do not respond to our hailing, but their movement reveal hostile intentions. Only signal that is coming from the ships is a simple message in Carcharorion language, repeated over and over again: "Some secrets are better left buried"."
 mem_lotc.27a:0 "We'll see about that."
 
 mem_lotc.28.name:0 "Fate of the Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc.28.desc:0 "Even though our understanding of Carcharorion is still limited, in our study of their home system we had collected enough data to identify a system they might have been considering for establishing their colony. Perhaps there we could find answers."
 mem_lotc.28a:0 "Onward!"
 
 mem_lotc.30.name:0 "Unigedd system"
 mem_lotc.30.desc:0 "We had successfully followed trail of clues reached the Unigedd system, where the Carcharorion survivors were heading away from their home system. \n\nWe are detecting large fleet present in orbit of a local gas giant, bearing Carcharorion markings."
 
 mem_lotc.31.name:0 "Unigedd system"
 mem_lotc.31.desc:0 "We had successfully followed trail of clues reached the Unigedd system, where the Carcharorion survivors were heading away from their home system. \n\nWe are detecting a faint signal originating from the gas giant in the system, as if someone is trying to contact us."
 mem_lotc.31a:0 "Prepare for contact."
 
 mem_lotc.33.name:0 "The last of the Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc.33.desc:0 "A faint signal is originating from the gas giant in the system. It went active right after the defenders of the system were destroyed, as if someone is seeking to meet those who did it."
 
 mem_lotc.34.name:0 "Contact established"
 mem_lotc.34.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is reporting that signal originating from the gas giant has been successfully decyphered. A currently unknown ship hidden within the gas giant is hailing us."
 
 mem_lotc.35.desc:0 " Hello, stranger. You have made quite a journey to this place. I am Bradwyr. The last of the Carcharorion."
 mem_lotc.35a:0 "So, what happens next?"
 mem_lotc.35a.response:0 "I honestly don't know. I'm old. I've survived thousands times longer than I had any right to. Stasis pod had prolonged my life, but even it has its limits. I'm bringing my ship up. I want you to have it. I know very little about your species. But I know you are destined for greatness. In the end, I want Carcharorion to be remembered for something. Many times I have improved my ship. It was the flagship of my forces. Use it to make a difference."
 mem_lotc.35b:0 "What happened to your people?"
 mem_lotc.35b.response:0 "We were once a civilization, not unlike your. We were looking at the sky dreaming of finding our place there. However, we were unlucky. It seems trivial now, but we weren't able to overcome the light barrier. We simply never got the right idea, it seems. \n\nConfined to our system forever, we were forced to expand in ways others would not. We had aspired to colonize barren worlds. To change them to suit our needs. But we didn't have enough resources. Some even tried to build a spaceship capable of surviving hundreds of years long journey in search for a new home. \n\nAs our civilization grew, so did its needs. Shortages had led to war. Our homeworld against the rebellious colonies. The rebellion was quelled, but everything they built - destroyed. As a final act of defiance rebel survivors launched several asteroids at the homeworld. With planetary defences crippled, they couldn't stop it. This war claimed 99% of our population. \n\nBut it wasn't the end. Right before the war, fortune smiled on us. It seems our system was visited by some alien species, even if we didn't get to meet them. One of their ships had crashed leaving remains for us to find. This was a way out of the system for survivors. \n\nHowever, we have lost our way. Many had become driven by nothing but will to survive. We had experimented with neural implants. We didn't meet any advanced civilizations in our time, but we found plenty of primitives, like even your own species, I believe. Some took to experiment with neural implants. Tried to rewrite their minds to house us. Our memory, personality, culture. If we could, we would take over a planet, covertly, and rebuild our society in new bodies. But we failed."
 mem_lotc.35c:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_lotc.35c.response:0 "As I said, my name is Bradwyr. I was the chief scientist in the project to study the alien vessel. When we saw the way to save our species it was promising, we knew it can't be allowed to fall in the hand of our government or the rebels. We sabotaged our work and hid. We worked in secret, allowing a select few to become our benefactors. In the end, we had a powerful ship with faster-than-light capabilities and blueprints to make more. \n\nWhen the war came, I led the rescue effort. We saved only a few thousands. We seeked to rebuild our civilization but in doing so we once again split. I believed that we should never repeat the same mistake. To make it our duty to protect the galaxy. My opponents disagreed. They were driven to survive at any cost. We became divided once again and we fought among ourselves. And my side lost. \n\nIn my last attack, I had led what remained of our forces to the battle. Once it became clear we have lost I had dived into the gas giant. They thought I've crashed my ship, but I merely hid."
 mem_lotc.35d:0 "The last? Sorry we killed the rest."
 mem_lotc.35d.response:0 "Don't flatter yourself. Carcharorion were dead long ago you reached out to the stars. What you fought were merely husks. Mutilated corpses driven by crude neural implants. Fading digital echoes. Ghosts of the past."
 
 mem_lotc.36.name:0 "Legacy of the Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc.36.desc:0 "A massive ship had emerged from the surface of the gas giant. We are not picking up any life signs from inside. It seems the ship is our to take."
 mem_lotc.36a:0 "This ship will serve us well."
 mem_lotc.36a.phile:0 "Carcharorion will not be forgotten."
 mem_lotc.36a.phobe:0 "Their species had failed test of time."
 mem_lotc.36a.mat:0 "Their knowledge will be put to good use."
 mem_lotc.36a.sp:0 "Providence had led us to them."
 mem_lotc.36a.mil:0 "We salute the proud Carcharorion."
 mem_lotc.36a.pac:0 "We will not make the same mistakes they did."
