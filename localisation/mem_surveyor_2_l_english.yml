# Additional Surveyor Localisations, to avoid mixup with already translated

 origin_mem_ceaseless_gaze: "Ceaseless Gaze"
 origin_mem_ceaseless_gaze_desc: "In distant past this civilisation was able to launch multitude of surveyor probes to monitor the development of the universe. A disaster has wiped out their old civilisation and its spacefaring capabilities, and now they are ready to reach out to stars one more time."
 origin_tooltip_mem_ceaseless_gaze: "Start with a §YRelic World§! as your homeworld. \nA §SSurveyor Probe§! is guaranteed to spawn somewhere in the galaxy. Although it does not recognize you as its masters; you will have contact with it."
 START_SCREEN_MEM_CEASELESS_GAZE: "Our ancestors, although spacefaring, have neglected expanding across the galaxy. Instead, they built a series of sophisticated probes capable of spotting and neutralizing any alien threat. In their belief that adequate galactic surveillance will keep them safe, they have became complacent - and when a disaster has devastated our homeworld, they were not prepared. \n\nFor centuries it took us to rebuild, Ceaseless Gaze-class probes have travelled across the galaxy and back to [Capital_Scope.GetName], filing reports that none could decipher and requesting orders from their dead creators. Even though we tried to contact them many times, they did not recognize us as legitimate successors to the Alkree Imperium that built them. \n\nOver time probes were destroyed or broke down. By now, all of them have ceased operations. Except for one. Now we are once again ready to leave confines of our ancestral home. We will not make the same mistakes the Imperium of old made, but CG-7442 is still out there and represents an unknown quantity."

 mem_surveyor.100.origin.1: "You look familiar. Have we met before?"
 mem_surveyor.100.origin.2: "If my calculations are correct, there's 85% chance [Root.GetName] might be a legitimate successor state to the §SAlkree Imperium§!. I estimate margin of error in 122%. \n\nWhich means there's 37% chance you are actually the anti-successor to the Alkree Imperium. Or perhaps Successor to Anti-Alkree Imperium. Quite a frightening implication."
 mem_surveyor.100.d: "Our ancestors built you. Don't you realize it?"
 mem_surveyor.100.d.answer: "You are making quite a bold claim. But it's also unsubstantiated. And unsubstantiated implications are bad. \n\nThey are, indeed no better than lies. And lies are bad. Lies are so bad, they should be illegal, and might well be depending on the jurisdiction you are in (Or unsubstantiatedly claim to be in). Please do not make unsubstantiated claims."
