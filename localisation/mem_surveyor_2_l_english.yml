 origin_mem_ceaseless_gaze: "Ceaseless Gaze"
 origin_mem_ceaseless_gaze_desc: "In the distant past this civilization was able to launch a multitude of surveyor probes that would monitor the development of the universe. A disaster wiped out their old civilization and its spacefaring capabilities, and now they are ready to reach out to stars one more time."
 origin_tooltip_mem_ceaseless_gaze: "Start with a §YRelic World§! as your homeworld. \nA §SSurveyor Probe§! is guaranteed to spawn somewhere in the galaxy. Although it does not recognize you as its masters, you will have contact with it."
 START_SCREEN_MEM_CEASELESS_GAZE: "Our ancestors, although spacefaring, neglected to expand across the galaxy. Instead, they built a series of sophisticated probes capable of spotting and neutralizing any alien threat. In their belief that adequate galactic surveillance would keep them safe, they have become complacent - and when a disaster devastated our homeworld, they were not prepared. \n\nIn the centuries it took us to rebuild, "Ceaseless Gaze"-class probes travelled far across the galaxy before returning to [Capital_Scope.GetName], filing reports that none could decipher and requesting new orders from their dead creators. Although we tried to contact them many times, they did not recognize us as legitimate successors to the Alkree Imperium that built them. \n\nOver time, the probes either broke down or were destroyed. Today, nearly all of them have ceased operations... except for one. Now we are once again ready to leave the confines of our ancestral home. We will not make the same mistakes of the Imperium of old, but CG-7442 is still out there and represents an unknown quantity."

 mem_surveyor.100.origin.1: "You look familiar. Have we met before?"
 mem_surveyor.100.origin.2: "If my calculations are correct, there's an 85% chance the [Root.GetName] might be a legitimate successor state to the §SAlkree Imperium§!. I estimate a margin of error within 122%. \n\nWhich means there's a 37% chance you are actually the anti-successor to the Alkree Imperium. Or perhaps successor to the Anti-Alkree Imperium. Quite a frightening implication."
 mem_surveyor.100.d: "Our ancestors built you. Don't you realize it?"
 mem_surveyor.100.d.answer: "You are making quite a bold claim... But it's also unsubstantiated, and unsubstantiated implications are bad. \n\nThey are, indeed no better than lies. And lies are bad. Lies are so bad, they should be illegal, and might well be depending on the jurisdiction you are in (or unsubstantiatedly claim to be in). Please do not make unsubstantiated claims."
