They where send on a scientific mission to explore formerly unknown worlds and stellar mysteries. Their mission progressed well until they found a strange gravitational anomaly in an asteroid belt. According to the survivor it must have been some kind of unstable wormhole that pulled their ship out of normal space. When they regained consciousness their ship was disabled and adrift, slowly entering the atmosphere of a planet they had never seen before. They are not even sure to still be in the same galaxy as there are no known reference points to be found. Without any company aside from his loyal ai assistant he still managed to live off this alien world for more than two years.\n\nWith little hope to ever return home again the survivor offers his service as a scientific officer in return for accommodation."

Two long days he dragged himself forward without a single drop.\n\nFinally, he resolved himself to use the only source of liquid remaining to survive allowing him to last long enough to reach a milder region. Our observers are still disgusted by said display."
