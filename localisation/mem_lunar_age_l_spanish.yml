The relationship between the two planets is uneasy due to the exploitative policies of homeworld nation-states and corporations, which are bent on exploiting the colony.\n\nWe should consider building §YObservation Posts§! above their worlds to study them more closely."

 mem_lunar_age.301.desc:0 "People of the [From.GetName] have for some time been dissatisfied with relationship between them and the bulk of [home_faction.GetName]. \n\nRecently, this dissatisfaction has been especially pronounced, with the populace rioting on the streets and politicians conspiring in dark rooms. If nothing changes, it seems that [home_faction.GetName] will face a violent uprising and potentially devastating civil war."
 
 mem_lunar_age.303.name:0 "Independence Granted"
 mem_lunar_age.303.desc:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, governing bodies of the [home_faction.GetName]'s many nation-states have ratified a treaty with their Lunar counterparts. \n\nThis new agreement seeks to mitigate injustice done to colonists and allow them full self-governance and economical and political independence."

 mem_lunar_age.306.name:0 "Independence Denied"
 mem_lunar_age.306.desc:0 "Predictably, elites of the [home_faction.GetName] did not take kindly to their colony's attempt to break away. \n\nIf the current course doesn't change soon, we can expect a full-scale war between the two planets."

I am authorized to handle communications with you. \n\nDelegates from most nations on [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName], as well as from the so-called [moon_faction.GetName], have gathered here today to hear what you have to say. Perhaps, with your help, we can avert the terrible disaster ahead."
 mem_lunar_age.313.aggro:0 "Very well, alien. Knowing your firepower, we will have to give in to your demands and listen to what you have to say. \n\nDelegates from most nations on [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName], as well as from the so-called [moon_faction.GetName], have gathered here to await the outcome of your meddling.

 mem_lunar_age.313.a.response:0 "Very well. As long as we are both left to our own devices, we have an agreement. Those on [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] can have their independence. Procedures to officially recognize [moon_faction.GetName] as a sovereign nation will finish shortly."
 mem_lunar_age.313.b:0 "Restore the status quo. The colony belongs to its benefactors on the home world."

 mem_lunar_age.313.c.tooltip:0 "We will attempt to annex [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName] and [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName]. But the natives might not go quietly."
 
 mem_lunar_age.314.desc:0 "Very well. You have a point. \n\nYou have travelled across the galaxy while we are squabbling over a single rock. Independence has brought us to the brink of total annihilation. \n\nWe surrender to your authority."
 
 mem_lunar_age.315.desc:0 "What? You must be joking. \n\nFirst you offer to host a negotiation, and now you are demanding we surrender to you? This won't happen. \n\nWe are ready to defend ourselves, even if the war is hopeless, and we will fight you to the bitter end. Come and conquer our worlds if you dare, alien."

 mem_lunar_age.317.desc:0 "After a brief nuclear missile exchange between [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] and [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName], what was left of the national governments on the homeworld have issued a declaration of unconditional surrender. \n\nThe self-proclaimed [moon_faction.GetName] has secured its status as a power independent from its former homeworld."
 
 mem_lunar_age.319.name:0 "[home_faction.GetAdj] Colony Surrendered"
 mem_lunar_age.319.desc:0 "After a brief nuclear missile exchange between [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] and [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName], it became clear that fledging military power of the separatists is no match for the established forces of the homeworld. The self-proclaimed government of the [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] has declared an unconditional surrender and allowed officials from [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName] to once again take control of the moon."

 mem_lunar_age.321.desc:0 "After a brief nuclear exchange between [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] and [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName], colonial forces overwhelmed the defences of the homeworld and delivered a devastating blow. \n\nIt appears that the population of [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName] has been wiped out and the planet itself has entered nuclear winter. \n\nDespite their victory, colonials are far from jovial, with many mourning the great loss of life in the war."
 
 mem_lunar_age.323.name:0 "[home_faction.GetAdj] Colony Destroyed"
 mem_lunar_age.323.desc:0 "After a brief nuclear exchange between [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] and [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName], the fledging defences of the lunar colony have proven to be woefully inadequate at deflecting the homeworld's attack. \n\nIt appears that the population of [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] has been wiped out and the moon itself has entered nuclear winter. \n\nAll nations on [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName] are mourning the great loss of life in this war."
 
 mem_lunar_age.325.name:0 "The [home_faction.GetName] has been Destroyed"
 mem_lunar_age.325.desc:0 "An exchange of nuclear strikes between [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] and [home_faction.capital_scope.GetName] escalated rapidly.

 mem_lunar_age.401.desc:0 "Our observation post has reported a massive war breaking out between nation-states on [the_planet.GetName]. \n\nIt appears to be the culmination of a long dispute over colonial rights on the planet's moon [moon_faction.capital_scope.GetName] that has escalated to a conflict using atomic weapons. \n\nAs of this moment, [the_planet.GetName] is entering a state of nuclear winter, with its population dead or with no hope of survival. \n\nStill, the [moon_faction.GetName] survives, as [From.GetName]'s colonists on the nearby moon helplessly watch their kin destroy themselves. Now they are the ones tasked with carrying on their species' legacy."
