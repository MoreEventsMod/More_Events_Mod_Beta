 #First Anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress_category:0 "Inside the Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress_category_desc:0 "Deep scans indicate an unusual shape on the surface, indicating a possible artificial structure."
 #Second Anomaly (Loop)
 mem_lava_fortress_loop_category:0 "Lava Fortress"
 mem_lava_fortress_loop_category_desc:0 "This ancient complex is still a mystery to us. We have to uncover its secrets..."
 
 #simple fail - thats it
 mem_lava_fortress.1.name:0 "Just Hot Air"
 mem_lava_fortress.1.desc:0 "It appears the strange shape was just a plateau where heat and the uneven density of magma distorted the scans. Nothing artificial was found at the site."
 mem_lava_fortress.1.a:0 "Time to move on then."
 
 #hard fail - start the loop
 mem_lava_fortress.2.name:0 "Danger Room"
 mem_lava_fortress.2.desc:0 "Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin. Looking further into the complex, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] wandered into what [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall. When a team member blithely pulled an unmarked lever, multiple spikes rapidly emerged from the floor, then retracted as quickly as they had appeared. Iconography that appeared when the lever was pulled suggests these spikes were intended to train users in dodging techniques.\n\nBy the look of it, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] and most of [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were mediocre dodgers at best..."
 mem_lava_fortress.2.a:0 "Send in a second team. This is not over!"
 mem_lava_fortress.2.b:0 "This complex is a death trap! We should seal it off!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.3.name:0 "A Death in Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress.3.desc:0 "The research team successfully located an abandoned complex on the planet's surface. However, when exploring its vestibule, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] appears to have stepped on a pressure plate of some sort, causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling, filling the entire complex. Both the fortress and our science team are lost."
 mem_lava_fortress.3.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.4.name:0 "A Colossal Cave-in"
 mem_lava_fortress.4.desc:0 "The strange shape turned out to be an alien outpost of some sort. However, after choosing to explore the interiors, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] unwittingly pulled a lever seated in one of the rooms, causing the sole support column to suddenly snap, resulting in a cave-in and the total destruction of the entire complex."
 mem_lava_fortress.4.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #hard fail - continues the loop
 mem_lava_fortress.5.name:0 "More Traps"
 mem_lava_fortress.5.desc:0 "Another science team has successfully entered the complex. Despite their best efforts to not pull any dangerous levers that might unleash "unpleasantries", [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] apparently unwittingly stepped on a hidden pressure plate, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling, filling the room [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] and [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were in."
 mem_lava_fortress.5.a:0 "Send another team. We won't give up!"
 mem_lava_fortress.5.b:0 "This complex is a death trap! We should seal it off!"

 mem_lava_fortress.7.desc:0 "The research team successfully got into the fortress.

 #Success in first try
 mem_lava_fortress.10.name:0 "Lava Fortress"
 mem_lava_fortress.10.desc:0 "Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin. From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects, a substantial portion of their history could be reconstructed. The facility was established in harsh conditions under the belief that, deep underneath, they could find a vein or two of a rare--and to them incredibly valuable--ore. By pumping magma to the surface, they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defence system relying on multiple lava floodable areas, as well as finding a means of disposing their "undesirables"--as shown extensively and repeatedly in the reliefs.\n\nAt first, the outpost grew steadily, and its prosperity attracted many newcomers. Many inhabitants not only worked in the mines but also turned to fine arts, creating objects intricately decorated with fractal images of themselves and other beautiful yet weird creations.\n\nDespite being constantly besieged by nebulous rivals, the colony endured for multiple generations, but as the dig to the planetary core drew near conclusion, a catastrophic event from inside the community must have happened. As best we can determine from the state of these ancient remains, and also the fact that there are only remains of this one alien species, our science team came to the conclusion that there must have been a devastating civil war. Also, the alien's storage containers were filled with a plethora of goods and equipment, disproving the hypothesis that the crisis was caused by a resource shortage. To the amusement of the others, one of our scientists pointed out there wasn't any kind of protective foot gear despite the fact that most of the reliefs found emphasized it as an important sign of social standing. Unfortunately, our team was unable to uncover any further details."
 mem_lava_fortress.10.a:0 "Truly, all xenos are mad..."
 mem_lava_fortress.10.b:0 "Such a unique and amazing species..."
 mem_lava_fortress.10.c:0 "Do WE have enough boots?!"
