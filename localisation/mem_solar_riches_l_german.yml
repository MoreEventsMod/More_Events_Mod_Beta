 mem_solar_riches_category_desc:0 "Scans of this star indicate the possible nearby presence of a series of small structures. Our best trajectory estimates imply a slowly decaying orbit."

 mem_solar_riches.1.desc:0 "Science officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has found a number of decrepit solar collectors built by an unknown alien race. Even in their bad shape, they still continue to collect solar energy with a greater efficiency than we have ever managed ourselves."
 mem_solar_riches.1.a:0 "Extract the energy reserves and scrap them."
 mem_solar_riches.1.b:0 "Study their underlying construction."

 mem_solar_riches.2.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that all traces of the structures have disappeared and apologizes for the resources spent calculating the orbital decay of non-existent objects."
