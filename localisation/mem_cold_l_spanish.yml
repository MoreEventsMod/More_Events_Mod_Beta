 mem_cold_dig_site: "Cold Comfort"
 mem_cold_dig_site_desc: "The surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is extremely cold, much colder than expected based on its position in the system. Even though it's uninhabitable now, the decaying ruins of an industrial civilization are scattered across the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], suggesting relatively recent and extremely drastic climate change."
 
 mem_cold.1.name: "The Dead World"
 mem_cold.1.desc: "Archaeological studies on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! decisively confirm the initial observations from the orbit - the planet was, indeed, at some point home to sapient organic life, a large mammalian species who called themselves the §SHoreef§!. Their technology level was clear pre-spaceflight, although at the time of their destruction the natives were undergoing industrialization and technological progress. The process was hampered somewhat by their limited supply of energy - the planet didn't have sufficient amount of fossil fuel or fissile materials. \n\nDespite having access to weapons of mass destruction, the Horeef didn't destroy themselves in an apocalyptic war, nor is there any indication of civil unrest or invasion from space. However, there's definitely something wrong with the planet, as evidenced by the unusual pattern of decay in buildings, other Horeef remains and soil, along with ionizing radiation coming from an uncertain source. \n\nIt remains a mystery what destroyed their civilization - it is as if all life on the planet was snuffed out overnight. If it was a weapon, it's nothing we previously encountered."
 mem_cold.2.name: "State of Decay"
 mem_cold.2.desc: "The more §Y[Leader.GetName]§! and [Leader.GetHerHis] expedition explore the ruins of Horeef civilization, the more strange occurrences they come across. \n\nThe radiation detected earlier doesn't come from any kind of contamination by radioactive materials. Instead, stable isotopes, with a half-life of millions of years, are decaying at vastly increased speeds - enough to be detected by standard radiological equipment. Complex compounds are measurably decomposing in ways inconsistent with any chemical process we could expect to happen at freezing temperatures. Even the starry sky seems dimmer somehow when observed from the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThese phenomena are spreading radially from a spot on one of the larger landmasses. This would likely be their source."
 mem_cold.3.name: "The Sky Razor Project"
 mem_cold.3.desc: "The exploration of the origin point of the strange anomalies that plague §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has proven to be perilous and fruitless - the area itself has mostly turned into radioactive shifting sand. However, data from there was transferred to remote locations for backup, and some of those are still usable. \n\nAs established earlier, the Horeef struggled with energy shortages to sustain their civilization, and to combat this they started a project codenamed §SSky Razor§!. They were hoping to discover an unlimited source of energy by opening some sort of dimensional rift and syphoning it from another universe. \n\nThe facility where research was conducted worked and sent reports up until the disaster that destroyed the Horeef civilization, but from the look of it, they were not successful. In fact, according to §Y[Leader.GetName]§!, they weren't even close to any kind of working prototype - their research was complete nonsense. \n\nThis means it's highly unlikely Sky Razor is responsible for planet's destruction. Yet, there's obviously a link."
 mem_cold.4.name: "A Hole in the World"
 mem_cold.4.desc: "Further measurements taken at the site of the former Sky Razor facility and extensive research of the reports lead §Y[Leader.GetName]§! to the startling conclusion that the Horeef were not responsible for their destruction: someone else was. \n\nThe Sky Razor researchers were not even close to opening any kind of rift, that much is clear, but it seems someone, in a different universe - likely an alternate universe version of the Horeef - did. Their equivalent of Sky Razor was successful and tapped into our universe for an unlimited supply of energy by creating a rift on the very same spot where the Sky Razor facility stood. The initial opening caused a large amount of energy to be syphoned from the local space. This energy included the heat and energy of chemical and nuclear bonds, causing matter to be ripped apart. This effect was most devastating at the site of Sky Razor, but remained fatal to all forms life elsewhere, especially when coupled with a massive drop in temperature. \n\nThe flow of energy has slowed down since but remains a constant drain, with the rift continuing to syphon energy from the planet. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to collapse the rift from our side or contact the other - even assuming anyone is still artificially keeping the rift open and it's not a self-sustaining runaway process. \n\nOn the other hand, as long as we steer clear of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we would not experience any negative effect, as the drain strength decreases exponentially. If this process continues, the life cycle of the §Y[From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! system's star will be shortened by merely a few thousand years and the heat death of the universe will come about a decade sooner. Hardly something to worry about."
 mem_cold.4.a: "This is still troubling."
 
 mem_cold_irradiated_trait: "Irradiated"
 mem_cold_irradiated_trait_desc: "This leader was subjected to a massive amount of exotic radiation. No superpowers have manifested so far, malignant neoplasms are expected in large numbers however."
