 mem_science_convention.1.name:0 "Science Convention"
 mem_science_convention.1.desc:0 "Our scientists believe we may be able to boost all avenues of current research if we were to host a large-scale convention dedicated to interdisciplinary sciences."
 mem_science_convention.1.ayes:0 "An excellent idea."
 mem_sciencecon_1.a.tooltip:1 "Preparations for the Science Convention are now underway and will be completed in 12 months."
 mem_sciencecon_1.b.tooltip:1 "Preparations for the Science Convention are now underway and will be completed in 12 months; in the meantime, we should send our invitations."
 mem_sciencecon_1.c.tooltip:1 "Unable to start the Science Convention due to lack of funds.\nResources required - \n£energy  §Y250§! \n£minerals  §Y250§!"
 mem_science_convention.1.ano:0 "Alas, we do not have the funds to undertake such a grand project."
 mem_science_convention.1.b:0 "Yes, let us see who else would like to take part."
 mem_science_convention.1.c:0 "No, this is a daunting task as is."

 mem_science_convention.2.name:0 "Science Convention Preparations Complete"
 mem_science_convention.2.desc:0 "The preparations for our convention are finally complete; now all that is left to do is to open the gates."
 mem_science_convention.2.a:0 "Let's get this show on the road!"

 mem_science_convention.3.name:0 "A resounding success!"
 mem_science_convention.3.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was a huge success! Scientists from all over our empire came together to share concepts and ideas, illustrate new inventions and work together to develop new theories. With the help of all these new minds put to different tasks, several difficult conundrums have been solved and multiple existing mechanisms have been streamlined or replaced with better ones altogether."

 mem_science_convention.3.a.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was a huge success! Scientists from all over our empire came together to share concepts and ideas, illustrate new inventions and work together to develop new theories. With the help of all these new minds put to different tasks, several difficult conundrums have been solved and multiple existing mechanisms have been streamlined or replaced with better ones altogether. The boon to our various scientific fields has been immeasurable and our role as creator of the convention has made us be viewed far more favourably in the eyes of everyone involved."
 #Message for the invited to see
 mem_science_convention.3.b.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences we attended was an absolute success! Though our scientists' presence was negligible when compared to that of §Y[invite_sender.GetName]§!'s researchers, they were nevertheless an astoundingly gracious host. The free flow and exchange of ideas was immensely beneficial to our various lines of research, and the §Y[invite_sender.GetAdj]§! lectures were enlightening beyond what even our most staunch optimists believed they would be. The opinion of many of our scientists has changed drastically for the better in their regards, and many would not mind repeating this event in the near future."
 mem_science_convention.3.a:0 "An achievement for the annals of history!"

 mem_science_convention.4.name:0 "A noteworthy event."
 mem_science_convention.4.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences went precisely as expected. Scientists from assorted star systems attended and assorted intellectual trading has opened several new interesting lines of inquiry. Our organizers assure us that this has been an extremely beneficial event for our various fields of research."
 #Message for the invited to see
 mem_science_convention.4.a.desc:0 "Though our scientists had their doubts, they are happy to report that the Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was pleasantly uneventful. Though many of the technologies being demonstrated and most of the concepts on display were already known to us, the chance to exchange ideas and theories with a scientific community with a radically different background has given much food for thought to our scientists, as well as an understanding of the §Y[invite_sender.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! they did not possess before."
 mem_science_convention.4.a:0 "Excellent news."

 mem_science_convention.5.name:0 "An Unfortunate Fiasco."
 mem_science_convention.5.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences did not, unfortunately, go as well as we would have hoped. Though the security team was under strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, someone nevertheless managed to sneak some in, leading to the inebriation and public embarrassment of several scientists. What's more, it seems that our researchers have developed somewhat of a rivalry with each other based on their respective fields, and many of our physicists caused a scene when they provoked our engineering department."
 #Message for the invited to see
 mem_science_convention.5.a.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was somewhat of a failure. Despite our host's best efforts, some of their unruliest scientists managed to sneak a few intoxicating substances through security, and heightened hostilities led to a few violent confrontations between their rival researchers. Our own scientists could barely get a word in edgewise, and many generally regard the event as a 'total waste of time'. Perhaps it'd be best not to attend next time."
 mem_science_convention.5.a:0 "Absolutely reprehensible."

 mem_science_convention.6.name:0 "A Total Catastrophe!"
 mem_science_convention.6.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was an absolute failure. Despite having strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, our security team allowed various drugs to be transported into the convention, causing widespread chaos and several hospitalizations. What's more, a respected scientist among our staff attempted to impress a potential mate by prematurely activating an experimental weapon of his own design. The weapon promptly exploded, causing widespread panic, injuring several researchers and killing said scientist. The Convention was cancelled at this point, and many of our science officers had to be taken into custody."

The Convention has been deemed as a national failure the likes of which have never been seen before, and many of our invited guests have come to view us poorly as a result. It may take some time to erase this black mark off of our reputation."

 mem_science_convention.6.b.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences we attended was abhorrent at best and a direct insult to our people at worst. Our host's scientists were irresponsible and juvenile, casually wielding dangerous technologies and putting others at risk for the satisfaction of their petty rivalries. One particular individual's attempt to impress a potential mate resulted in several injuries and the loss of their own life, putting a premature and swift end to the event. Whether this was some kind of joke in poor taste or an intended affront to our people, several of our scientists don't believe it worth the effort to maintain diplomatic relations with the §Y[invite_sender.GetName]§!"
 mem_science_convention.6.a:0 "An embarrassment of colossal proportions."
 mem_science_convention.6.a.host.tooltip:0 "A scientist dies!"
