 mem_ashes_category_desc:0 "The barren surface of [Root.GetName] is completely devoid of life. But this might not have always been the case..."
 
 mem_ashes.999.name:0 "Most Definitely a Barren World"
 mem_ashes.999.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that repeated sweeps of [FromFrom.GetName] have confirmed a complete lack of any signs of life, past or present. \n\nAny indications to the contrary have proven to be false leads."
 
 mem_ashes.1.name:0 "Beneath the Surface"
 mem_ashes.1.desc:0 "Though the surface of [From.GetName] is blasted by cosmic radiation and completely devoid of life, what lies beneath tells a different story. \n\nIt seems the planet was at some point home to a moderately advanced pre-spaceflight civilisation, and our explorers found multiple underground structures, presumably used for storage, transportation and shelter. The most significant of these is a surviving piece of underground rapid transit system, connected to a vast bunker, presumably a fallout shelter. Inside, they discovered large amount of hastily setup primitive stasis pods, still operational and containing aliens in suspended animation. \n\nThe complex is too damaged to reactivate it on site, but we could extract pods and bring them off-world for more convenient examination and possible reactivation."
 mem_ashes.1.a:0 "Bring them home. Perhaps the aliens can be saved."
 mem_ashes.1.b:0 "Leave the pods in place. We don't have time for this."
 mem_ashes.1.c:0 "Dispose of the helpless aliens."

 mem_ashes_chain_desc:0 "The sleeping pods we found on [their_planet.GetName] contain the last known survivors of the planet's destruction."
 
 MEM_ASHES_EXTRACT:0 "Extract the Sleeping Pods"
 MEM_ASHES_EXTRACT_DESC:0 "The sleeping pods are clearly hastily constructed with very primitive technology. The ravages of time made them even more unreliable. Moving them off-world requires delicacy and precision."
 
 mem_ashes.2.name:0 "Sleeping Pods Retrieved"
 mem_ashes.2.desc:0 "We have successfully transferred the sleeping pods from [their_planet.GetName] to a secure facility on our home world. Reactivating them might be tricky, but our technology should allow us to do it without incident."
 mem_ashes.2.a:0 "We should consider our options..."
 
 MEM_ASHES_REVIVE:0 "Revive the Sleepers"
 MEM_ASHES_REVIVE_DESC:0 "We can now revive the aliens we found on [their_planet.GetName]. The pods are not particularly stable, but we have the technology necessary to work around possible hazards."
 
 MEM_ASHES_AUTOPSY:0 "Sleeper Autopsy"
 MEM_ASHES_AUTOPSY_DESC:0 "There's little need to wake the aliens from [their_planet.GetName] up. Dissecting their still living, frozen bodies would tell us more than any awake conversation."
 
 mem_ashes.3.name:0 "Sleepers Revived"
 mem_ashes.3.desc:0 "It took us considerable effort to successfully activate the revival protocols in the sleeper pods from [their_planet.GetName]. As the translation software was calibrated, survivors were able to share their story... \n\nThey call themselves the [their_species.GetNamePlural]. Their species had advanced to the early space age, but with their first interplanetary spaceship already under construction, they discovered abnormal activity on their sun. In anticipation of a cataclysmic solar flare, their governments secretly arranged to use old fallout shelters to store the best and brightest of their society using primitive cryonic technology. \n\nThe plan was to revive them to start a new civilization once the danger had passed, but the flare was far more severe than any could anticipated. \n\nWith the entire surface of the planet sterilized and the atmosphere blown away, the all-clear signal was never received and the pods were left to degrade until the last surviving pod was recovered by our researchers. \n\nBut now, as the sleepers have awoken and acclimatized, we can't keep them in our research facilities forever. A new permanent accommodation needs to be arranged..."

 mem_ashes.4.desc:0 "Our scientists have completed the dissection of the pod inhabitants we found on [their_planet.GetName]. The data obtained is invaluable, but with the last survivors of that species finding their demise on our examination tables, their kind had been wiped out forever."
 mem_ashes.4.a:0 "That's life."
 mem_ashes.4.b:0 "Worth it!"
 mem_ashes.4.c:0 "Data extraction successful."

 mem_ashes.6.desc:0 "Greetings! Do you remember us? \n\nEven though it is regrettable that you weren't able or willing to offer us a place in your own empire, we have not forgotten your kindness and will forever be grateful to you for saving us from that vault. \n\nWe are doing well and have already found a new world for ourselves. One of our leaders, who was instrumental in creating the vault initiative in the first place, has expressed the wish to join your empire and provide expertise as a sign of our gratitude. Are you interested?"
 mem_ashes.6.a:0 "Not particularly, no."
 mem_ashes.6.b:0 "Very well."

 MEM_ASHES_ASSIMILATION_DESC:0 "It is a rare opportunity to work on organics who are incapable of protesting at their assimilation. They won't even need to wake up for us to learn all about them and their past."
 
 mem_ashes.7.title:0 "Sleepers Assimilated"
 mem_ashes.7.desc:0 "It took us considerable effort to successfully extract subjects from the sleeper pods found on [their_planet.GetName]. As we added them to our collective, we pieced together their story. \n\nThey call themselves the [their_species.GetNamePlural]. Their species had advanced to the early space age, but with their first interplanetary spaceship already under construction, they discovered abnormal activity on their sun.
