 mem_voggo_dig_site: "In the Clouds"
 mem_voggo_dig_site_desc: "A large station is hovering in the upper atmosphere of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. \n\nIts exterior, though suffered heavily from passage of time and powerful winds, is unusually luxurious. The station itself seems abandoned long ago."

 mem_voggo.1.name: "The Antechamber"
 mem_voggo.1.desc: "The luxurious interiors of the station on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! took significant effort to match out and catalog. The twisting passages have turned into hazardous areas from the damage sustained and the air inside has became dangerously volatile from malfunctioning life-support systems. \n\nThe strangest thing about all this seems to be the decorations. Every room contains at least one statue or portrait of the same individual striking some kind of magnificent pose."
 mem_voggo.2.name: "Send in the Clones"
 mem_voggo.2.desc: "As archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! pushed into the depths of the station's interiors, they started encountering dead bodies. Some of them were killed by gunfire, blades and blunt implements, but others seem to have perished from life support failure. \n\nAll of the bodies appear to be genetically identical, bearing strong resemblance to the portraits aboard. However, different bodies show different level of development and health - some were significantly disfigured compared to the others, or show shrunk cranial area. \n\n[Leader.GetName] believes that all of them are clones of the same individual replicated with different degree of success. The most degenerated ones were probably results of multiple generations of cloning."
 mem_voggo.3.name: "Cloning Laboratory"
 mem_voggo.3.desc: "Closer to the core of the station [Leader.GetName] has found several rooms seemingly dedicated to cloning. It seems to be the place of a major battle, as most of the equipment is smashed or shot to pieces. Cloning vats still contain half-formed bodies, and sampling machines are badly damaged, as if someone kept smashing them to reach whoever was inside."
 mem_voggo.4.name: "The Inner Sanctum"
 mem_voggo.4.desc: "Until now we believed station was abandoned. We were mistaken. \n\nIn the inmost part of the station [Leader.GetName] discovered a sealed off section shielded from the outside. \n\nInside [Leader.GetSheHe] discovered a still living alien, also sharing appearence with the art on the station. Judging by lack of disfiguring genetic defects, he is likely the original template for the clones whose corpses litter that station. He wishes to speak to us."
 mem_voggo.4.pur: "Kill him instead."
 mem_voggo.4.swarm: "Eat him instead."
 mem_voggo.5.name: "Voggo the Great"
 mem_voggo.5.desc: "Ah, someone has come to free me from my confinement! \n\nPlease, allow me to introduce myself. I am §SVoggo the Great§!, also known as The Magnificent, The Wise, The Anointed, The Reviled, The Shunned, The Betrayed and The Exiled. I was once a ruler of a great and bountiful §YVorkun Nation§!, do you recognize the name? Though so. Serves them right. \n\nNow that I am finally free, please allow me to offer you my services. I am the best administrator you'll ever see."
 mem_voggo.5.a: "Very well. Welcome aboard."
 mem_voggo.5.a.tooltip: "§YVoggo the Magnificent§! becomes our new §SGovernor§!."
 mem_voggo.5.b: "We'd rather not employ you."
 mem_voggo.5.c: "What's your story?"
 mem_voggo.5.c.responce: "Oh, this is a thrilling tale, full of intrigue, treachery and betrayal. I wrote a book about it a few decades ago, but I think I accidentally processed it through one of the food machines. Don't worry, I'll write another one. For now I'll give you an abridged story. \n\nThe §YVorkun Nation§! I hail from was once a powerful empire on galactic stage and I was her leader. I wasn't the only one, but I was gifted with talents others were not. I could see things hidden from the rest. People would look up and always consulted me on important matter, recognizing my endless wisdom. Times were good, for a while. \n\nBut being blessed with a foresight and power can be a terrible curse. While the rest of Vorkuns lived their lives in happy ignorance, I anticipated a terrible calamity. I saw the writing on the wall and it was mostly obscene doodles. \n\nI have came before the Great Senate, saying that they have a choice - give me absolute power or perish. They said that I have a choice - exile or death. They made their choice and I made mine. From the look of it, I was right, and they were wrong."
 mem_voggo.5.d: "What happened on this station?"
 mem_voggo.5.d.responce: "This was my private station, my safe haven. After arriving in my exile, I was fresh out of friends, allies and companions and I had no choice but to make my own. Who else would be fit to that if not someone who'd share my boundless intelligence? So I procured a few cloning machines and started the work. \n\nThe process was more flawed than I anticipated however, as my clones were not blessed with the same level of patience and compassion as I. many have turned against me. As I sought refuge in my innermost sanctum, they turned on one another, and each tried to clone themselves into an army. Soon first generation of clones were dead, but each left behind their own clones. Generation after generation, they grew more numerous and less sane, until life support could no longer put up with them. I was protected by my own personal equipment while they suffocated. \n\nIt was fun, for a while. But I'm glad they all died."
