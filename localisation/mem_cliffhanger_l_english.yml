 mem_cliffhanger_dig_site_desc: "An artificial structure of some kind is built into a massive cliff, overlooking a massive tectonic crevice. Its walls are blocking all sensors and do not allow to map its underground parts from orbit, but if exposed parts are any indication, it's made in a shape of a massive cylinder. There doesn't seem to be any doors, windows or other points of entry. \n\nWho could have built such a thing on a lifeless [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] and why?"
 mem_cliffhanger.1.name: "Screwed"
 mem_cliffhanger.1.desc: "So far we didn't make much progress researching the underground structure on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. \n\nThe structure is impregnable to anything that could be applied without risk of damaging whatever valuables could be found inside. State-of-the-art shielding technology on the wall keeps preventing any scans that could reach through the ground - for them the wall looks like the same rock, all the way through. \n\nSmall-scale demolitions were conducted in the cliff's face to reveal more of the wall's structure. It is not all smooth, and a spiral ramp of a sort is going across it, giving the whole thing semblance of a giant §Sscrew§! or perhaps a drill of a sort. \n\n§Y[Leader.GetName]§! now intends to start exploring other possible angles, starting from the top."
 mem_cliffhanger.1.a: "Let's try another angle."
 mem_cliffhanger.2.name: "Going From Above"
 mem_cliffhanger.2.desc: "Digging down from the top of the cliff was met with better success than previous attempts to get inside the strange structure on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. Although it's still fortified, the roof of the cylinder is actually containing a hatch that can be opened. \n\nInside, we have encountered first evidence that it was meant to house organic inhabitants. The top floor of it seems to be some kind of lobby, meant to greet visitors coming from the top. Walls are covered in colourful decorations and banners with slogans in language we do not yet recognize. Piles of pre-packaged snacks and bottles of drinks lie on the tables, preserved by sterile environment, but obviously ancient. \n\nIt seems whoever the construction was meant for never arrived here."
 mem_cliffhanger.3.name: "The Turn of the Screw"
 mem_cliffhanger.3.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! has successfully explored most of the structure found on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. On the lower levels, the archaeologists have found engineering section. The data cores are fused into lumps of molten carbon by some kind of self-destruct mechanism, but some of the more intriguing details have been revealed by studying the machinery. \n\nFor once, this structure was not originally built on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. It was assembled elsewhere, then dropped from the orbit and burrowed into the ground under its own power. Once this is done, population would move in and the hole would be filled, burying it forever, undetectable and isolated from the rest of the world. Using its own power source, the self-sustaining complex would survive for centuries, perhaps millenia. \n\nBut most of the systems were never activated."
 mem_cliffhanger.4.name: "Sanctuary 1187"
 mem_cliffhanger.4.desc: "Although most of the data cores were destroyed for good, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! found a few functioning ones on the deeper levels of the structure. The same self-destruct mechanisms that melted the rest were triggered, but seem to have malfunctioned, and nobody has double-checked on them. because of it, it's now possible to discern the real purpose of the complex. \n\nThe building is called §SSanctuary 1187§! and is one of the many such structures manufactured and spread across the galaxy. \n\nThe creators anticipated some kind of unspecified calamity would befall the entire galaxy and their worlds in particular and believed the only way their species could survive is by creating a large number of underground vaults or sanctuaries such as this one to be covertly inserted into remote planets and be sealed forever, each housing several thousands residents. They were never meant to be found, or be opened from inside, keeping the residents safe, forever. \n\nThe one that was dropped on [From.Planet.GetName] was discarded however, as it has landed too close to a fault line, threatening exposure. Indeed, their fears were justified, as aeons later we have found it sticking out of a cliff. The technology that went into this undertaking will no doubt be useful for our own industry, but there's no information on location of any other Sanctuaries in the galaxy or how many were deployed."
 mem_cliffhanger.4.a: "They could still be right next to us!"
 mem_cliffhanger.4.a.phobe: "They better stay hidden!"
 mem_cliffhanger.4.a.phile: "Poor things, all alone underground."
 mem_cliffhander.4.a.swarm: "No canned food can elude us forever."
