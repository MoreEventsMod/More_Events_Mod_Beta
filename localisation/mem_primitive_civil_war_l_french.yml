 MEM_PRIMITIVE_CIVIL_WAR_INTERVENTION_DESC:0 "One of our ships will provide the much needed assistance for the almost defeated rebels on [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName], even though the natives won't understand what is happening. A few well-placed shots from orbit should rout the imperial forces with ease."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.2.name:0 "The Way of the Warrior"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.2.desc:0 "Our observation post orbiting [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] has reported an ongoing civil war within the leading [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] nation. All apparently started with the coronation of a young and progressive successor to the throne whose many reforms soon had far-reaching impacts on his country's culture and society.\n\nWhile the [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.species.GetNamePlural] are still living in a quasi-medieval era, their technological progress is much more advanced than this. Only strict adherence to tradition has prevented widespread application of many innovations so far. These changes were not approved by all of his subjects though. In particular, the newly instated imperial army built of conscripts without regard to social class deeply offended the now obsolete noble warrior class.\n\nFacing their decline into irrelevance, many of them rose up in defence of their ancient rights. But their chances of success are small, despite their ability and experience, as they are bound to their warrior code and traditions which forbid them from using the modern equipment the new imperial army fields.\n\nThe sword faces the gun."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.2.a:0 "Continue observing."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.name:0 "Destiny Draws Near"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.desc:0 "The observation staff above [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] reports that, after some initial successes, the rebels suffered a series of major defeats, depleting their numbers and forcing them to retreat. It appears they have taken a defensible position to prepare for a last stand. The imperial army seems reluctant to attack for now, realizing their tactical disadvantage despite their superior numbers.\n\nIn any case, total victory for the imperial forces is just a matter of time at this point, as the rebels have run out of options. Or have they?"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.a:0 "They are surrounded and outnumbered. It is over..."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.3.b:0 "The only thing that could save them is "divine" intervention..."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.4.name:0 "Destiny is Here"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.4.desc:0 "The [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] rebel leader on [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet.GetName] prepared his men for a final battle. He intended to go out in a blaze of glory rather than facing disgrace by accepting an offer of surrender sent by the emperor himself.\n\nTheir last charge ended in a crossfire of rapid firing guns, another innovation fielded for the first time in [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] history. It was not a final battle but a one-sided slaughter.\n\nNonetheless, with the end of the rebellion, the last remaining staunch defenders of the old ways died and made way for the future. A brighter one, hopefully."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.4.a:0 "When the new meets the old it always ends the ancient ways."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.5.name:0 "Imperial Force Defied"
 mem_primitive_civil_war.5.desc:0 "Just as the rebel leader was about to begin his final charge into certain death, the ground was shaken by [root.owner.GetAdj] weapon strikes. They struck near the besieging army, close enough to have the desired effect but not so near as to cause casualties.\n\nThe imperial army was routed completely and the rebel forces stood victorious without any further loss of life. Word of a military leader who is apparently favored by the divine quickly spread across the country, gaining him more support than his initial cause alone could have ever done.\n\nFacing the dwindling support by his people, the young emperor was forced to come to terms with his opponents, leading to a revocation of his reforms and an amnesty for the remaining rebels in order to save his rule.\n\nThe [mem_primitive_civil_war_planet_owner.GetAdj] civilization will stay medieval for the time being, it appears."
 mem_primitive_civil_war.5.a:0 "Favored by the divine, huh?"
