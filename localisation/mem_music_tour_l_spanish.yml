 mem_music_tour.8.name:0 "A Stellar Performance"
 mem_music_tour.8.desc:0 "A popular musician from the §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetName]§! has been topping their charts lately, and has even garnered a mild success abroad. Looking to break through on a galactic scale, he has set his sights on a possible tour on §Y[mem_tour_location.GetName]§!. A part of the local population is stoked for what they consider to be a once in a lifetime event, although there are some who claim his music has questionable influence on our youth."
 mem_music_tour.8.xenophile:0 "What an opportunity to witness his culture first hand!"
 mem_music_tour.8.xenophobe:0 "Deny him entry, and ban his music for good measure."
 mem_music_tour.8.individualist:0 "Everyone has the right to an opportunity at stardom."
 mem_music_tour.8.lodsofemone:0 "I know; I'm the one selling tickets."
 mem_music_tour.8.collectivist: "We shouldn't idolise vain individuals."
 mem_music_tour.8.religiousdogma:0 "The way he rumbles his §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesOrganName]§! is highly indecent. Ban this filth."
 mem_music_tour.8.freeforall:0 "We should broadcast this event live across our country!"
 mem_music_tour.8.freeforall.tooltip:0 "([Root.GetName]):\n   §YXenophile§! pops gain §G+15%§! Happiness for §Y24§! months\n   §YXenophobe§! pops gain §R-15%§! Happiness for §Y24§! months"

 mem_music_tour.9.name:0 "The First Concert on Tour"
 mem_music_tour.9.rock:0 "\"Good morning §Y[mem_tour_location.GetName]§!! Are you ready to rock? I say, are you ready to rock?\"\n\nThe §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetAdj]§! band, styling themselves \"Blasters N' Orchids\", energetically set in the first song of the evening. The universal translating system on stage had trouble following the lead singer, nearly overheating during certain parts of his performance. When he turned it off, the audience seemed to know the §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! lyrics by heart."
 mem_music_tour.9.dubstep:0 "Crowds of fans stood in the arena for the §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetAdj]§! artist's debut in §Y[mem_tour_location.GetName]§!. The audience exploded in rapturous cheers when he walked on stage, nodding their heads to a heavily synthesized musical score that occasionally built up before arbitrarily dropping the bass. One can't help but wonder why he had to come all the way to §Y[mem_tour_location.GetName]§! to press a button on stage."
 mem_music_tour.9.incomprehensible:0 "The §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetAdj]§! artist must have brought some sort of instruments on stage. It would be impossible to explain the crowd's reaction otherwise. And yet, when he played them, there was only silence.\n\nA cursory investigation revealed that §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! music is traditionally played at frequencies that §Y[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! can't hear."
 mem_music_tour.9.festival:0 "The §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetAdj]§! band played in an open field under a radiant sun. On the festival grounds, various groups of unwashed and sleep-deprived fans milled about, ingesting unhealthy amounts of alcoholic beverages and abusing questionable substances. This scene repeated itself on various locations on §Y[mem_tour_location.GetName]§!, always leaving a trail of refuse and trash in its wake. But everyone agreed they had a lot of fun."
 mem_music_tour.9.rapper:0 "The §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetName]§! musician, styling himself \"50 creds\", was less singing than firing off a rapid barrage of §Y[mem_rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! slangs and slurs. During the final act of the night, he glorified the lifestyle of his working class family, a neighbourhood that was often heart-breaking and sometimes violent, after which he thanked the audience, asked them to \"keep it real\" and left for the next tour location on his luxurious private shuttle."
 mem_music_tour.9.metal:0 "The musicians, self-styled as §Y\"Power[mem_rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesNameCompliment]\"§!, were clad in black leather, studded with the occasional metal chains or spikes. The vocalist let out a primal growl that caused the universal translator on set to spout nonsense, though the equipment was soon drowned out by music that seemed to hit around 200 decibels. The typical \"dance\" to this performance seemed to consist of violent head convulsions."
 mem_music_tour.9.dontunderstand:0 "I don't understand the appeal, really."
