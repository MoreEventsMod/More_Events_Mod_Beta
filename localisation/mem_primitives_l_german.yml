 #ONE SMALL STEP

 mem_primitives.101.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: One Small Step"
 mem_primitives.101.desc:0 "Today our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has witnessed an important benchmark of the native primitive civilization's advancement: A manned craft launched from the planet's surface reached its natural satellite - §Y[the_moon.GetName]§! - with the crew leaving the craft for a prolonged period of time and walking across its surface. Although at this stage of development we can't expect such ventures to be able to establish permanent outposts, nonetheless it's a major achievement for the [From.GetName]. \n\nThe crew of the observation post had the good sense to manoeuvre out of sight and avoided detection for now."
 mem_primitives.101a:0 "Congratulations."
 mem_primitives.101a.phobe:0 "Why can't they keep their filth to themselves?"
 mem_primitives.101a.mat:0 "They are on the right path."
 mem_primitives.101a.matphile:0 "They grow so fast!"
 
 #WORLD WARS
 
 mem_primitives.301.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Global Conflict"
 mem_primitives.301.desc:0 "Today marks the new age of §Y[From.GetName]§!. After a prolonged period of tension, an otherwise fairly minor diplomatic incident has sparked a massive conflict between multiple international blocks. Almost the entire planet is now involved in the conflict, with the death toll projected to outstrip any other incident they could've brought on themselves. \n\nIt remains to be seen who will come out of it triumphant, but without a doubt this ordeal will have a profound effect on the planet's history."
 
 mem_primitives.303.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: The War is Over"
 mem_primitives.303.desc:0 "A bloody conflict that had raged for some time on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has finally come to an end. The peace treaty signed today effected a massive change on the political landscape, with multiple nations rising to prominence or falling from grace overnight. \n\nBut is this the end? Marred with massive reparation payments, humiliation and territorial losses, the losers will doubtlessly plan their revenge as soon as they can muster their strength."
 mem_primitives.303a:0 "An armistice for 20 years."
 
 mem_primitives.305.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: To End all Wars"
 mem_primitives.305.desc:0 "Conflict raging on amongst the §Y[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! had been in stalemate for some time, with all sides suffering catastrophic losses in both personnel and economy. \n\nToday, it seems to have finally come to an end with a white peace signed between the belligerents. With traumatic memories of the war fresh in the public's minds, the people of the planet have come to shun military aggression and see mutual understanding as the way forward, hoping to never experience the horrors of war again."
 mem_primitives.305a.milphobe:0 "A shameful display."
 mem_primitives.305a.pacphile:0 "They have finally seen the light."
 
 mem_primitives.307.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: New Global Conflict"
 mem_primitives.307.desc:0 "Today, the fragile peace on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has been upset anew. The nation that suffered the most humiliating defeat in the previous conflict and faced the brunt of the hardship it brought recently fell under the control of a ultra-nationalist government led by a charismatic leader. It has been showing aggression for some time now, but this time other major nations finally decided that appeasement must end. \n\nArmed with the ferocious fanatism of their people and advanced military doctrines, those revanchists are a formidable power backed by a block of similarly resentful nations, but only time will tell if they have what it takes to wage war on almost the entire world and turn its history around."
 mem_primitives.307a:0 "We knew it would happen eventually."
 
 mem_primitives.309.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Second Peace"
 mem_primitives.309.desc:0 "The war that was raging on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has come to an end. It seems that the history of §Y[from.GetName]§! is prone to repetition, with the same block that won the first global war winning the second. \n\nWith the aggressors obliterated and their ideologies thoroughly discredited, we can expect this to become one of the major turning points of their civilisation."
 
 mem_primitives.311.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: New World Order"
 mem_primitives.311.desc:0 "Against all odds, the aggressive block that started the global conflict on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has emerged victorious. \n\nThey might not control the entire planet, but they have reclaimed their status and emerged as the dominant power. With their nationalist rhetoric validated and their war crimes swept under the proverbial rug, we can expect a profound change in the course from the §Y[from.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!."
 
 #RELIGIONS
 
 mem_primitives.401.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious Development"
 mem_primitives.401.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a major shift in the §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA formerly minority cult founded by a mystic who was executed for his seditious behavior has flourished into a major religion and spread far and wide. Popular among the poor and disenfranchised, it teaches forgiveness and tolerance as its core values and promises heavenly rewards in the afterlife for those who lead a virtuous life. \n\nNow that it has reached prominence and become a powerful societal force, we can expect its values to shift towards more hegemonic attitudes, though."
 mem_primitives.401a.mat:0 "Were we this stupid once?"
 mem_primitives.401a.sp:0 "We'll see if they are on the right path."
 mem_primitives.401a.sphile:0 "They are coming to the truth in their own way."
 mem_primitives.401a.sphobe:0 "We'll deal with this heresy eventually."
 
 mem_primitives.403.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious Development"
 mem_primitives.403.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a major shift in the §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA religion founded by a tribal warlord mystic has been spread across the large regions through conquest and conversion. A warlike faith, it is tightly interwoven with statecraft and extols discipline and the willingness to make sacrifices to ensure its spread across the globe, promising paradise to those who fall fighting in its name."
 
 mem_primitives.405.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious Development"
 mem_primitives.405.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a major shift in the §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA new religion has been gaining prominence across the planet, focusing on finding inner peace through introspection and asceticism. Believing that all souls are bound to be endlessly reborn over and over again, it promises its followers a chance to break away from the endless cycle of reincarnation and achieve eternal bliss in nothingness."
 
 mem_primitives.407.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Religious Development"
 mem_primitives.407.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed a major shift in the §Y[from.GetName]'s§! development. \n\nA quasi-religious teaching, combining religious trappings with pseudo-scientific presentation, is gaining popularity among its elites. It teaches that most of the problems that plague society originate from alien activity in the planet's past, more specifically an alien ruler who committed mass murder of his subjects on the planet's surface. \n\nAllegedly, ghosts of the dead aliens are now haunting [the_planet.GetName], causing mental anguish among the population." 
 mem_primitives.407a:0 "Preposterous. We did no such thing."
 
 #EPIDEMICS
 
 mem_primitives.501.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Plague"
 mem_primitives.501.desc:0 "We are detecting a new strand of highly virulent bacteria on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. The highly contagious disease is spreading across the planet like wildfire and, with medical science as primitive as that of the [From.GetName], it can potentially wipe out the entire population. \n\nOf course, with our advanced medical knowledge, we would have an easy time stopping its spread, if we were so inclined."
 mem_primitives.501a:0 "Begin developing a cure."
 mem_primitives.501b:0 "We should not interfere."
 mem_primitives.501b.phobe:0 "Things break, xenos die."
 
 mem_primitives.503.name:0 "The [from.GetSpeciesNamePlural] Wiped Out"
 mem_primitives.503.desc:0 "The observation post over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! reports that the last sentient beings on the planet have been wiped out by the plague that ravaged on its surface. The §Y[from.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! are now officially considered extinct and the observation outpost has been dismantled, as there's nothing left to observe. \n\nThe plague is not dangerous to our own citizens, though, so we are free to colonise the planet if we are so inclined."
 mem_primitives.503a.phobe:0 "Things break, xenos die."
 mem_primitives.503a.matphobe:0 "They have lost the game of evolution."
 
 mem_primitives.505.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Plague is Over"
 mem_primitives.505.desc:0 "We are no longer seeing any new cases of the plague that used to ravage the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. It likely ran out of viable hosts, leaving behind those who are naturally immune."

 mem_primitives.506.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Cure Delivered"
 mem_primitives.506.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has successfully dispersed a synthetic vaccine into the planet's atmosphere designed specifically to counter the plague that is ravaging §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. \n\nWe are expecting the infection rate to drop to zero within a month. The plague is effectively over."
 
 MEM_PRIMITIVES_BD_CURE_PROJECT:0 "Plague Vaccination"
 MEM_PRIMITIVES_BD_CURE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The synthetic vaccine designed in our labs could be covertly dispersed into the planet's atmosphere, preventing its primitive population from possibly being wiped out."
 
 #TERROR
 
 mem_primitives.601.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Devastating Terrorist Attack"
 mem_primitives.601.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! today experienced a significant mass casualty event. Several radicalized citizens attacked a major cultural and economic center on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! causing possibly the most devastating single terror incident in the planet's history. \n\nWith a death toll of thousands and images of burning buildings fresh in the minds of the populace, this event will likely be a turning point in this civilization's history."
 mem_primitives.601a.mil:0 "Looks like someone got tired of diplomacy..."
 mem_primitives.601a.pacphobe:0 "At least we have outgrown such savagery. Right?"
 
 mem_primitives.603.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Atomic Terror!"
 mem_primitives.603.desc:0 "The crew of the observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported witnessing a massive explosion today. They were concerned that natives are about to wipe themselves out with nuclear weapons, but it has become clear that this was an isolated incident. Seemingly, a few radicals stole a powerful nuclear device from the military and used it to destroy one of the population centres on the planet's surface.\n\nAn event of such proportions will definitely change the history of [From.GetName]."
 
 #Y2K
 
 mem_primitives.701.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Digital Disaster"
 mem_primitives.701.desc:0 "The observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! reports witnessing cascade failures in the planet's infrastructure. \n\nThe §Y[From.GetName]§!, which has relatively recently adopted widespread electronic computers, was apparently ill-prepared to adequately handle date changes, as a change of year number overflowed their variables, resetting the date to zero. \n\nOur researchers report the shutdown of most communication infrastructure and disruption in transportation and utilities, as well as several nuclear power plants going into meltdown. With the emergency code patches being delivered, this event is unlikely to destroy the civilisation, but it will certainly affect their perception of technology."
 mem_primitives.701a:0 "Too bad."
 mem_primitives.701a.sp:0 "They put too much faith into machines."
 mem_primitives.701a.sphobe:0 "They paid the price for relying on soulless machines."
 mem_primitives.701a.mat:0 "Astounding incompetence..."
 mem_primitives.701a.matphile:0 "They will make it through and learn."



 #Fall of Rome
 
 mem_primitives.801.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Fall of an Empire"
 mem_primitives.801.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! reports that the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] civilisation has been dominated by a single large empire for almost a millennia. With a territory spanning over a fifth of the world's inhabitable surface and containing almost a third of all [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] at its height, it has been a hub for learning and culture. Cities have been built, technologies discovered, new levels of prosperity reached.\n\nHowever, over the past fifty years, it seems that the empire has weakened. A combination of internal strife and newly-ascendant external enemies seeking a part of their wealth have laid the empire low. Recently, a large force of what the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] intelligentsia consider "barbarians" penetrated into the heart of the empire and sacked the capital city before rampaging across the imperial heartlands, looting without restraint.\n\nAlthough the barbarians later retreated, we do not believe the empire will survive for long. This could set the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] back considerably."
 mem_primitives.801a:0 "Too bad."
 mem_primitives.801a.materialist:0 "Progress is a bumpy ride."
 mem_primitives.801a.sphobe:0 "Who cares?"
 mem_primitives.801.tooltip:0 "The [from.GetSpeciesNamePlural] regress to the Bronze Age."
