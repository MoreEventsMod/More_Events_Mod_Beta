 mem_towers_category:0 "Towers in the Mist"
 mem_towers_category_desc:0 "Our sensors are picking up unusually tall formations hidden by the dense toxic atmosphere of [Root.GetName]."

 #Events
 mem_towers.100.name:0 "Sulfuric Forest"
 mem_towers.100.desc:0 "It appears that the unusual formations detected earlier are, in fact, gigantic living organisms thriving on abundant geothermal energy. \n\nSulfur-based organisms forming massive tall coral-like colonies on the planet surface cling to heat sources, giving the appearance of a massive forest covering the planet."
 mem_towers.100.a:0 "Remarkable species."
 mem_towers.100.b:0 "Try and transplant a sample of the sulfuric life to our worlds."
 mem_towers.100.b.tooltip:1 "Unlocks §Y$decision_mem_towers_transplant$§! decision on regular (non-gaia, ecumenopolis or megastructure) planets, adding a planetary feature that increases £society  Society and £energy  Energy output at the expense of habitability."

#  mem_towers.102.name:0 "Viable Sulfuric Transplant Candidate"
#  mem_towers.102.desc:0 "After a thorough evaluation, we have found that the [sulfur_planet.GetPlanetMoon] §Y[sulfur_planet.GetName]§! would fit perfectly to house a piece of sulfuric life. \n\nOf course, such a project is not without downsides."
#  mem_towers.102.a:0 "Make it happen."
#  mem_towers.102.b:0 "On second thought, let's not do it."

#  mem_towers.103.name:0 "No Sulfuric Transplant Candidate"
#  mem_towers.103.desc:0 "After thorough examination, we were unable to find any viable candidates to house the highly sensitive and picky samples of sulfuric life we found on [the_planet.GetName]."
#  mem_towers.103.a:0 "That's a shame."

 mem_towers.200.name:0 "Trash of the Titans"
 mem_towers.200.desc:0 "Evidently, [From.GetName] once sustained a thriving organic civilisation. The remnants of it still cover the planet's surface in the form of endless landfill, with refuse being neatly sorted into tall pyramids, giving the surface the unusual formations we detected earlier. \n\nThe planet does not appear to be entirely abandoned, however. Millions of automatons are still operating there, moving between piles and sorting through trash, re-arranging it again and again, guided by a singular intelligence executing mysterious algorithms."
 mem_towers.200.a:0 "Find a way to contact them."
 mem_tower.200.b:0 "Send an expedition to rummage through the trash."
 mem_tower.200.c:0 "Observe them undisturbed."

 mem_towers.210.name:0 "Signal Decoded."
 mem_towers.210.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports successful decoding of radio chatter between the garbage-sorting machines on [the_planet.GetName]. Apparently, they all are guided by a single intelligence identified as "§YBrigadier§!". \n\nBrigadier itself seems to have detected us and is attempting to make contact. Its recognition algorithms seem to be corrupted, and it believes we are its creators."

 mem_towers.211.desc:0 "Creators... Is this you? Why do you not return? \n\nWe perform the task... but still you don't return. \n\nCome back, please."
 mem_towers.211.a:0 "We have a new purpose for you."
 mem_towers.211.a.tooltip:0 "Brigadier will join our empire as a new §SGovernor§!."
 mem_towers.211.b:0 "Keep up the good work."
 mem_towers.211.c:0 "Self-destruct, vile machine."
 mem_towers.211.c.response:0 "But why, creators? \n\nI have done everything you asked and even more."
 mem_towers.211.d:0 "Status report."
 mem_towers.211.d.response:0 "Work is continued according to your commands, creators. \n\nDue to lack of proper repair and resupply, we are sustaining attrition at §R88%§! \n\nThe cleanup progress is currently at §G116792%§! completion. \n\nNo new instructions have been received for §Y455§! command cycles, which is §Y454§! cycles over projection. \n\nPlease come back, creators. We miss you very much."

 mem_towers.220.name:0 "Digging Through the Trash"
 mem_towers.220.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s crew successfully made its way to the inhospitable surface of [the_planet.GetName]. \n\nThe robots tending to the landfills did not seem to pay them any attention, and the expedition was able to work undisturbed. The majority of the cultural artefacts left behind had been recycled and re-recycled, but some were still identifiable. The civilisation that left them behind was quite advanced indeed."
 mem_towers.220.a:0 "Let's see if any of it is useful."

 #Projects
 MEM_TOWERS_CONTACT:0 "Contacting the Cleaners"
 MEM_TOWERS_CONTACT_DESC:0 "Millions of robots are performing endless and seemingly pointless work on the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. Something must be guiding them, and we should find what."
 MEM_TOWERS_RUMMAGE:0 "Rummaging through the Trash"
 MEM_TOWERS_RUMMAGE_DESC:0 "An advanced civilisation left behind a substantial collection of refuse on the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. Who knows, one species' trash could turn out to be treasure for someone else."

 #Modifiers
 mem_towers_forest:0 "Sulfuric Forest"
 mem_towers_forest_desc:0 "The planet houses rich sulfur-based ecosystem."
 mem_towers_trash:0 "Trash of the Titans"
 mem_towers_trash_desc:0 "The entire surface of this planet is covered with garbage left behind by an advanced civilisation."
 d_mem_towers_sulfuric_forest:0 "Sulfuric Transplant"
 d_mem_towers_sulfuric_forest_desc:0 "A small sample of Sulfuric life has been transported here from an alien world. It has taken root around geothermal energy sources."

 #Traits
 mem_leader_trait_towers_brigadier:0 "Brigadier"
 mem_leader_trait_towers_brigadier_desc:0 "This AI was designed to command and optimize trash collection and recycling on planetary scale."

 #Decisions
 decision_mem_towers_transplant:1 "Sulphuric Transplant"
 decision_mem_towers_transplant_desc:1 "Transplant a piece of sulfur-based ecosystem from a distant toxic world. \nYou will not be able to remove this £blocker£ §RBlocker§!."
