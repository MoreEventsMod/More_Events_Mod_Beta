 mem_tales_of_yore.1.desc:0 "As [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] colonists spread across the world of [Root.GetName], expeditions travel out into the frontiers looking for suitable sites for new cities and production centres. Orbital scans can only show so much, after all. One such expedition has stumbled across something far more notable than expected, however.\n\nA vast cache of ancient books in some alien tongue has been found along with artifacts of many different varieties. From the paintings, statues, and even mummified aliens found within the cache, it appears as though an alien civilization existed on [Root.GetName] some indeterminable time ago. A special project has been issued to decipher the texts."

 mem_tales_of_yore.2.name:0 "Tales of Yore"
 mem_tales_of_yore.2.desc:0 "Our translation team was surprised to find just how much information was found within the texts found on [Root.GetName]. The long defunct civilization, though it never left the late iron age, appears to have had a storied history, with the cache's contents including artifacts and even some heroes mentioned within these sagas.\n\nThese sagas tell tales that took place over thousands of years, and according to radiometric dating, occurred hundreds of thousands of years ago, before the sudden and mysterious disappearance of the civilization. Tales of great warriors, brilliant philosophers, and great glittering cities are all found within their leather bindings. Furthermore, expeditions to where the sagas say the greatest cities were located has revealed ruins that are almost perfectly described by the maps.\n\nAlready the colonists have begun to take more pride in their world, and the media is caught up in a frenzy of adapting the sagas into movies, books, virtual-reality experiences, and even videogames. As for the planet itself, things are looking up."
