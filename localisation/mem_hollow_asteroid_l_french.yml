 #Anomaly Category Text
 mem_hollow_asteroid_category:0 "A Hollow Asteroid?"
 mem_hollow_asteroid_category_desc:0 "According to our scans, this asteroid's mass is curiously low for its enormous size, suggesting that beneath the rock surface it might actually be hollow."
 
 #Light Failure
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.name:0 "A Hollow Asteroid"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.desc:0 "The asteroid was indeed found to be hollow. In fact, it is not a single asteroid per se, but a group of several smaller asteroids that somehow became entangled and were welded together by aeons of diffusion. A curious structure, though of little value."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.1.a:0 "Disappointing..."
 
 #Critical Failure
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.name:0 "It was a Trap!"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.desc:0 "It appears that the hollow part of the asteroid was housing some kind of alien installation. However, as our science team managed to breach the wall, they apparently triggered some sort of self-destruct mechanism, vaporizing the asteroid alongside with them and their ship."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.2.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
 #Success: Space Mausoleum
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.name:0 "Space Mausoleum"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.desc:0 "As our science team found its way inside, they discovered something unexpected: dead aliens. Over a hundred bodies line the walls of the asteroids, dressed in ornamental clothes and accompanied by a variety of apparently everyday objects, preserved by the vacuum of space. Our analysis suggests that they all died over 300,000 years ago. This structure is a unique source of knowledge about this otherwise unknown alien species, their ways of life, and their physiology."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.a:0 "We can learn a lot from this."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.b:0 "Haven't they heard of recycling?"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.c:0 "They were seeking to be close to the divine..."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.10.d:0 "Their customs were fascinating."
 
 #Success: Space Resort
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.name:0 "Abandoned Space Resort"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.desc:0 "The insides of the asteroid harbour an incredible sight. Multiple habitat capsules cling to the walls of the asteroid while its centre houses a massive transparent sphere containing multiple artificial environments. Long abandoned and deactivated, it can be reactivated with ease, and with minimal adjustment can serve our own needs."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.a:0 "Convert it into a commercial resort."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.b:0 "Ensure as many citizens as possible enjoy this place."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.20.c:0 "Dismantle the structure and study it."
 
 #Success: Ancient Art Exhibition
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.name:0 "Ancient Art Exhibition"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.desc:0 "Our scientists have found something very strange. The inner walls of the asteroid are dotted with thousands of large crystals covered in pictograms and geometric patterns. Between different shapes, colours and carvings, the team could not find a single pair of identical crystals. Every single crystal is now imaged for the archives, but what their creator was trying to say might forever remain a mystery."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.a:0 "Those are gorgeous."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.b:0 "If nothing else, it is a good exercise in set theories."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.c:0 "A fitting tribute to the miracles of creation."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.30.d:0 "If only its creators were still around to share their vision with us..."
 
 #Success: Panopticon
 mem_hollow_asteroid.40.name:0 "Panopticon"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.40.desc:0 "When the science team breached the interior of the asteroid, they found countless small living pods fixed to the outer wall. A large sphere is anchored in the centre of the space, allowing a clear view of every pod. It appears the asteroid was used by a previously unknown ancient species as a high security prison under the idea that a handful of guards could covertly observe the inmates; remains of both are still littering structures. From data traces pulled from the station's computers, it appears that a faulty software update locked inhabitants out of the system, leaving them to starve. It's not clear why they weren't rescued--or at least had their bodies recovered."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.40.a:0 "We should study this prison's design."
 
 #Success: Kraken Quest Start
 mem_hollow_asteroid.50.name:0 "Abandoned Project"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.50.desc:0 "As our science team progressed inside the hollow asteroid, they found a complex tunnel system, leading towards a hollow core. Clearly artificially designed, they are lined with cables, support pylons and large canisters of unknown purpose, sealed shut and resistant to opening. A small orb is concealed deep inside the asteroid, containing data terminals. It will take time to decode the information they may contain, however."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.50.a:0 "Get working."
 
 #Project finished
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.name:0 "Kraken in Making"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.desc:0 "The data we pulled from terminals inside [From.GetName] contains information that is both incredible and highly disturbing. This entire place was intended to become the body of a powerful being, referred to as a Kraken, the product of genetic engineering by an ancient spacefaring race. The core and the tunnels were to be filled with organic tissue grown from gene seed preserved inside canisters. Self-propelled, self-sustaining and under its creator's mental control, it would be able to take on entire fleets by itself and win.\n\nIt appears, however, that this project was unfinished. The age of the canisters caused genetic damage to the Kraken gene seed, making it unusable. However, with its incredible regenerative capacity, introduction of tissue from another Kraken could repair it and allow us to create our own beast."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.a:0 "Try finding another Kraken to harvest..."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.51.b:0 "Scuttle the project. Some things are better left untouched..."
 
 #Success: Pirate Quest Start
 mem_hollow_asteroid.100.name:0 "Pirates"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.100.desc:0 "It appears that the naturally occurring cavern system inside the asteroid has attracted a group of criminals, who did not take kindly to our probing of their hideout. They have scrambled a small fleet of armed ships which are approaching quickly with their weapons powered up."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.100.a:0 "Prepare to engage!"
 
 #Pirate Ships destroyed
 mem_hollow_asteroid.102.name:0 "Pirate Fleet Defeated"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.102.desc:0 "The last pirate defenders have been neutralized. A tactical team may now enter their hideout to capture their base and secure it."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.102.a:0 "Send the marines in."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.102.b:0 "No need for this. Take the entire base out."
 
 #Boarding Project
 MEM_HOLLOW_ASTEROID_PIRATES:0 "Boarding the Pirate Base"
 MEM_HOLLOW_ASTEROID_PIRATES_DESC:0 "Our fleet has secured the area. It is time to move in our ground forces."
 
 #Pirate Base captured : Pirate Hideout Quest Line
 mem_hollow_asteroid.103.name:0 "Pirate Hideout"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.103.desc:0 "Our tactical team made its way through the pirate's defences, encountering desperate but fruitless resistance from the outlaws. Many of these criminals were killed in the shoot-out, but a few of them were successfully subdued and are now detained, awaiting interrogation. Additionally, a respectable amount of loot they had stolen from civilian transports over the years has been seized."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.103.a:0 "A job well done."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.103.b:0 "A job well done."
 
 #Pirate Trial
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.name:0 "Pirate Trial"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.desc.01:0 "The pirate gang our forces arrested earlier was composed of citizens of our own empire! Those criminals had sneaked outside of our main travel routes in stolen ships, which they then used to make a living by smuggling and raiding civilian traffic. Further interrogations confirmed that these pirates were acting alone, and now that all of them are either dead or detained we can assure our citizens that the terror is finally over.\n\nIt is still to be decided what should happen with the captives."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.desc.02:0 "The pirate gang we have in our custody was found to be mostly composed of §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetAdjective]§! citizens. They have terrorised civilian shipping lanes for years, mostly targeting their former nation. Further interrogations made it clear that they were acting alone and now the entire gang is either dead or arrested.\n\nThe §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! has submitted a formal request for extradition of the pirates so they can stand trial for their crimes against their people. To decline their request could have serious consequences for our diplomatic relations."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.a:0 "Hold a public trial."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.a.tooltip:0 "A public trial will be held. The "Protector of the People" modifier will be added to our empire, improving happiness by 5% for 10 years."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.b:0 "Summarily execute these traitors."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.b.tooltip:0 "These traitors will be publicly executed, boosting our influence."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.c:0 "Hold a public trial."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.c.tooltip:0 "A public trial will be held. The "Protector of the People" modifier will be added to our empire, improving happiness by 5% for 10 years. Additionally, all known empires except the §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! will get the "Pirate Hunter" opinion modifier. The §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! will be severely offended."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.d:0 "Summarily execute these pirates."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.d.tooltip:0 "These pirates will be publicly executed, boosting our influence. Additionally, all known empires except the §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! will get the "Pirate Hunter" opinion modifier. The §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! will be severely offended."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.e:0 "Extradite the pirates."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.e.tooltip:0 "All known empires will get the "Pirate Hunter" opinion modifier. The §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! will be pleased with our decision."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.f:0 "Offer them a deal."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.f.tooltip:0 "The captives will be presented with an offer of amnesty in return for their cooperation. The §Y[mem_hollow_asteroid_pirates_foreign_country.GetName]§! will be severely offended."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.g:0 "Offer them a deal."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.104.g.tooltip:0 "The captives will be presented with an offer of a reduced sentence in return for their cooperation."
 
 #The Deal: Secret stash
 mem_hollow_asteroid.105.name:0 "Secret Stash"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.105.desc:0 "We struck a bargain with the detained pirates. In exchange for a reduced sentence, they agreed to provide us with the location of a massive stash of loot they had acquired over the years. Among the recovered objects, we found a large quantity of valuable hardware and precious metals."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.105.a:0 "A good deal."
 
 #The Deal: Raiding Tactics
 mem_hollow_asteroid.106.name:0 "Raiding Tactics"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.106.desc:0 "In exchange for a reduced sentence, some of the pirates offered their tactical expertise. Years of raiding taught them quite a few tricks for evasion and manoeuvring, and our own fleet command will have much to learn from them. This should give us an edge in future conflicts."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.106.a:0 "A good deal."
 
 #The Deal: Hidden Battlecruiser
 mem_hollow_asteroid.107.name:0 "Hidden Battlecruiser"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.107.desc:0 "In exchange for a reduced sentence, some of the arrested pirates offered to direct us to something unique they had found on one of their smuggling runs: An advanced warship, seemingly abandoned by its crew after sustaining major damage. According to their story, they towed it towards a nearby asteroid field and hid it there in hope that one day they would be able to reactivate it, but such a day never came. With the resources of our empire, we should be able to restore this warship to working condition."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.107.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 #Repairing the Battlecruiser
 MEM_HOLLOW_ASTEROID_PIRATES_CRUISER:0 "Repairing the Battlecruiser"
 MEM_HOLLOW_ASTEROID_PIRATES_CRUISER_DESC:0 "According to the pirates, the ship is in a bad shape. Our scientists and engineers are optimistic about their ability to repair it."
 
 #Hidden Battlecruiser restored
 mem_hollow_asteroid.108.name:0 "Restoration Complete"
 mem_hollow_asteroid.108.desc:0 "The warship the pirates led us to is indeed fascinating. We have never seen a similar ship before--and perhaps never will, as its origin remains a mystery to us. Now, as this derelict has been repaired and its systems powered up again, the mighty vessel is ready to serve in our fleet. May its new crew have more luck operating it than its former masters."
 mem_hollow_asteroid.108.a:0 "Indeed a strange ship."
