 mem_sentinel_dig_site: "Dead and Buried"
 mem_sentinel_dig_site_desc: "A massive ship has been detected on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], mostly buried under tons of sand and dust. Its design is unlike anything we have seen before. \n\nNo signs of life or energy signatures are detected on the site, but the ship itself appears to be mostly intact."
 
 mem_sentinel.1.name: "Point of Entry"
 mem_sentinel.1.desc: "We have finally managed to make our way inside the ship - by digging through sand right through a hole in the hull. The compartment §Y[Leader.GetName]§! found [Leader.GetHerselfHimself] in appears to be a shuttle hangar that was breached from the outside by a small contingent of soldiers. \n\nSeveral bodies found scattered in the hangar appear to belong to a rebel faction in the §YColgari Empire§!, a star nation that existed several hundreds of years ago in a nearby region of space. The rebels apparently refused to recognize the authority of the Emperor Jorath, whom they believed to be an illegitimate clone impersonating the real deceased emperor. They carried out a mission to board his personal flagship - §SFirst Sentinel§! – in a desperate attempt to capture or assassinate him. \n\nIn this room, they engaged the contingent of loyalist marines and emerged victorious, establishing a foothold."
 mem_sentinel.2.name: "Central Control Hub"
 mem_sentinel.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] has managed to breach another room of interest. \n\nThis one appears to be a computer hub housing an AI core as well as another control terminal. Data from the terminals confirms that this ship is indeed the §SFirst Sentinel§! and Emperor Jorath was aboard at the time of the attack, travelling across the empire to gather support. \n\nAfter the attack, the crew attempted to activate the automatic defence systems, most of which were controlled by the on-board AI directly, but something went wrong: for some reason, android soldiers could not differentiate between the crew and the boarders and attacked both indiscriminately. \n\nJudging by the current state of the room, the crew managed to retake the hub and used explosives to disable the AI with extreme prejudice."
 mem_sentinel.3.name: "The Grand Hall"
 mem_sentinel.3.desc: "We have located a massive compartment occupying several decks in the middle of the ship. \n\nThis one appears to be a reception hall of some sort where the emperor would be able to host receptions and partake in other activities. \n\nJudging by the bodies on the floor and the overturned furniture, the rebels, the ship's security crew and the security robots all engaged each other in a massive firefight here. It is difficult to say who won, since all three sides suffered heavy losses in the process."
 mem_sentinel.4.name: "The Emperor's Quarters"
 mem_sentinel.4.desc: "Deep within the interior compartments of the ship, we found fortified quarters reserved for the emperor himself. \n\nThe luxurious compartment was shielded from weapon fire, radiation and other environmental factors, contained its own life support system and was stocked with luxurious items and delicacies to last for years. \n\n§Y[Leader.GetName]§! believes that the remains in the room belong to Emperor Jorath himself and six of his most trusted advisors and courtiers. The cause of their deaths seems to be - of all things - iodine poisoning. \n\nIodine had an intoxicating effect on Colgari physiology, inducing euphoria in small doses, but causing systemic organ failure in large quantities. The concentration in the mummified tissues appears to be 10 times greater than lethal. It is unclear whether this was an accident, suicide or murder."
 mem_sentinel.5.name: "The Fallen Sentinel"
 mem_sentinel.5.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! Reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] has finally successfully located the bridge of the ship. The damage to the systems of the bridge are minimal; and the events that transpired aboard leading to its demise are much clearer. \n\nIt turns out it wasn't fighting or an AI uprising that doomed the ship, but an engine malfunction. A minor defect in the plasma flow control system in one of the thrusters would've easily been fixed otherwise, but with the crew otherwise occupied with fighting and damage control in the interior and AI systems taken offline, there was nobody to monitor it. \n\nAs one of the conduits burst open, the ship was flooded with a massive amount of radiation, killing everyone outside of the specifically shielded Emperor's Quarters. Apparently this occurred outside of Colgari territory, and disabling the AI core both prevented a distress signal from being sent and disabled remote tracking by the rest of the navy. Without anyone to steer it, the dormant ship drifted through space for a very long time until it was captured by the gravity of [From.Planet.GetName] and crashed onto the surface. \n\nDespite all, the ship is actually still spaceworthy, and with minor repairs it can be made operational again to serve in our navy."
 mem_sentinel.5.a: "Repair the ship."
 mem_sentinel.5.a.tooltip: "Battleship §YFirst Sentinel§! will become a part of our navy."
 mem_sentinel.5.b: "Scrap it. The ship is nothing but bad luck."
