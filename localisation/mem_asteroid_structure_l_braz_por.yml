 mem_asteroid_structure_category_desc:0 "Our science ship has detected a strange network of structures on the surface of the asteroid that appear to be artificial in origin. Perhaps this is worth investigating."

 mem_asteroid_structure.11.name:0 "Asteroid Collision"
 mem_asteroid_structure.11.desc:0 "The apparent network of structures was little more than a deformity in the shape of the asteroid's surface, apparently the result of an impact in the last few million years. Asteroid collisions in a system this old are rare, but not particularly noteworthy."
 mem_asteroid_structure.11.a:0 "Oh well."

 mem_asteroid_structure.10.name:0 "Asteroid Weapon"
 mem_asteroid_structure.10.desc:0 "The artificial structures are only found on one side of the asteroid. Our best guess is that they are a network of carefully concealed engines. Though capable of limited thrust, they seem to be perfect for directing an object this large at a destination over an extended period of time, without the detectable emissions of a traditional method of interstellar propulsion. Radar and gravimetric telemetry have also revealed that the core of the asteroid is much denser than it should be if it were a natural formation.\n\nOur working theory is that this was a weapon targeted at a planet, moon or large station, and was disguised to look like a wayward asteroid at first. Only once it had impacted would its nature as a targeted kinetic kill vehicle be revealed. With its original core replaced by tungsten and other heavy elements, it would have enough mass to potentially render an entire world uninhabitable. Its existence, and the fact that its fuel pods are empty, imply that it missed its target. Study of the engine of this planet-killer weapon has yielded some intriguing details."
 mem_asteroid_structure.10.a:0 "We should keep a lookout for this kind of thing in the future."
