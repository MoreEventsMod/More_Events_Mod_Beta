 mem_poisoned_world_category_desc:0 "This [Root.GetPlanetMoon], though now covered in a cloak of noxious gas, was clearly inhabited at one point by an industrialized race. Dead cities litter the surface."

 mem_poisoned_world.100.desc:0 "Our examination of the abandoned cities on [From.GetName] has revealed yet another mystery. Rather than finding evidence of millions of bodies, Science Officer [This.GetLeaderName] has settled on the conclusion that this [From.GetPlanetMoon] was abandoned. Vast, hastily created mass transportation systems snake across the landscape, and instructions on the walls of several major cities directing citizens to evacuate have been uncovered.\n\nWhat happened next is still unclear. With no discernible evidence of a space program, the only other possible explanation lies in the strange archway structures erected at the center of these transportation networks. Not representative of any known method of inter-spacial travel, these devices have nearly disintegrated from centuries of exposure to this corrosive atmosphere. We may never know how these arches functioned, but just seeing what is possible has opened our eyes."
 mem_poisoned_world.100.a:0 "Analyse what's left."
 mem_poisoned_world.101.name:0 "Collective Insanity"
 mem_poisoned_world.101.desc:0 "A startling development has been reported by our science team exploring the ruins on [From.GetName]. The radioactive clouds and toxic gas were not caused by accident or natural calamity. Massive petrochemical plants exist purely for the purposes of belching out as many pollutants as possible, the soil has tested positive for several advanced neurotoxic substances, and large portions of the surface have been salted with deadly levels of radioactive cobalt in the recent past. The only possible explanation is that the populace of this [From.GetPlanetMoon] intentionally poisoned the skies and the surface of their own home.\n\nScattered debris and residual particulate evidence of energy weaponry imply there was a battle in orbit around this world. Perhaps there was an alien threat that these people could not hope to fight. Their response may forever be inscribed in the geological history of this world, as a series of craters consistent with the detonation of fusion devices form a pair of symbols from the inhabitants' main pictographic language. Several hundred kilometers in diameter, it appears to be an invective for the reader to copulate with themselves."
 mem_poisoned_world.101.a:0 "Oddly inspiring."
 mem_poisoned_world.200.name:0 "Hornet's Nest"
 mem_poisoned_world.200.desc:0 "The city-shaped structures on the planet turned out to be massive hive clusters, home to hundreds of millions of flying creatures. These multi-mouthed monstrosities swarmed [This.GetName] as it came down for a low-altitude survey, ripping into its hull with frightening ease. The ship managed to escape with only minimal damage, but the presence of these dangerous and highly territorial animals makes further investigation unadvisable."
 mem_poisoned_world.200.a:0 "Let us not do that again."
 mem_poisoned_world.200.a.tooltip:0 "The [This.GetName] has taken minor damage."
