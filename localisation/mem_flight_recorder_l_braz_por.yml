 #Base
 mem_flight_recorder_category:0 "Unidentified Signals"
 mem_flight_recorder_category_desc:0 "We are picking up repeating signals originating from §Y[Root.GetName]§!, presumably a distress signal or locator beacon."

 #Success
 mem_flight_recorder.1.name:0 "Flight Recorder"
 mem_flight_recorder.1.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has intercepted and recovered a small device orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§!.\n\nJudging by the extracted data, it's a flight recorder from a military cruiser, jettisoned right before the ship was driven straight into the star by armed raiders.\n\nDepending on which set of voices we listen to on the interior cabin recordings, these hijackers were either freedom fighters or nationalist fanatics. The defending crew describes the intruders as terrorists who seek to disrupt the fragile galactic peace in a cruel retaliation for having their nation's wanton aggression contained; the boarding party presents themselves as liberators who are willing to give their lives to free their people from the yoke of imperialist oppression that has been forced upon them by treacherous neighbours.\n\nEither way, the raw stream of flight data could be useful in research of our own."

 #Failure
 mem_flight_recorder.2.name:0 "Signal Lost"
 mem_flight_recorder.2.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! was unable to isolate and track the signal again. Its source is likely lost forever."

 #Critical Failure
 mem_flight_recorder.3.name:0 "Booby Trap"
 mem_flight_recorder.3.desc:0 "Soon after the ship salvaged a small device orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§!, we lost contact with them. It appears the device was rigged to explode when brought aboard a spacecraft, likely as some sort of booby trap."
