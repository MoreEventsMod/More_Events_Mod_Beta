 #Project
 MEM_SLEEPERS_SCAN:0 "Alarming Energy Readings"
 MEM_SLEEPERS_SCAN_DESC:0 "Our observation post over §Y[From.GetName]§! is reporting unusual and alarming signals coming from the planet. Experts are needed to fully analyze the situation, but preliminary readings indicate that disaster may be imminent."
 
 mem_sleepers.2.name:0 "Down Below"
 mem_sleepers.2.desc:0 "Our observation post on §Y[From.GetName]§! is reporting unusual and alarming signals coming from the planet. They are picking up an energy signature originating beneath the planet's surface in an isolated region. The signal's strength is beyond anything native technology can produce and is remarkably similar to our own power plants. More alarmingly, the signature clearly indicates a growing instability in the power source. This will likely end in disaster if we don't act fast."
 mem_sleepers.2.a:0 "Send in specialists to investigate this."
 
 #Failed to do the project (Soft Fail)
 mem_sleepers.3.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.3.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivalling a supervolcano eruption. Whatever there was to be found at ground zero is now certainly vaporised.\n\nOur observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are astonished by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear of the gods' wrath."
 mem_sleepers.3.a:0 "Seems like it could have been worse."
 
 #Failed to do the project (Hard Fail)
 mem_sleepers.4.name:0 "Ground Zero"
 mem_sleepers.4.desc:0 "A massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power surpassing that of a supervolcano eruption. It triggered supersonic pressure waves throughout the planet's atmosphere, cascading series of massive earthquakes, and smothering plumes of dust and cinders sufficient to send the entire planet into permanent twilight. This catastrophe devastated the biosphere and extinguished the native civilization. Whatever we could have found at the ground zero was certainly vaporized.\n\nOur observation post has been shut down as there is no one left to observe."
 mem_sleepers.4.a:0 "I wish we could have prevented this."
 mem_sleepers.4.b:0 "What a waste of a decent planet..."
 
 #Finished Project
 mem_sleepers.5.name:0 "Underground Vault"
 mem_sleepers.5.desc:0 "The energy signature on §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§! required precise drilling from our science team but ultimately led them to a vast cavern system. Once inside, the team uncovered a large artificial structure deliberately concealed within. The structure was unambiguously built using space-age technology, centuries ahead of what the natives of this planet should be capable of. Within this structure, the crew was startled to find countless sleeping pods lining the walls, containing aliens not only inconsistent with the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, but also some unlike any other species known to us, as well as a massive stockpile of advanced military hardware. Yet the language used on terminals and labels bears a remarkable resemblance to languages we learned by observing the natives.\n\nOur engineers have assessed the situation in the reactor control, which proved rather anticlimactic after the earlier discoveries. Centuries, if not millennia, without maintenance have taken their toll, but with our level of technology, stabilizing the reactor should be trivial, especially if we are willing to sacrifice some of our own resources."
 mem_sleepers.5.a:0 "Try to stabilize it and reactivate the vault."
 mem_sleepers.5.a.tooltip:0 "An amount of 500 energy credits will be used for this project."
 mem_sleepers.5.b.tooltip:0 "As we lack the needed 500 energy credits, we'll have to borrow the amount from our private sector."
 mem_sleepers.5.c:0 "Just depower all systems and scrap the vault for valuables."
 mem_sleepers.5.c.tooltip:0 "Our team will start dismantling everything not necessary for the vault's structural integrity."
 mem_sleepers.5.d:0 "Xeno lives aren't worth risking our team. Let's blow it up."
 
 #Looting the Vault and potentially getting uplifting tech option
 mem_sleepers.6.name:0 "Technological Treasure"
 mem_sleepers.6.desc:0 "After powering down the sleeper pods and sending their occupants to their final rest, our team began to analyze all the potentially useful materials, as well as the historical and technological data stored in the vault's central server.\n\nThe builders of this place called themselves the Ozari. They appear not to have achieved interstellar spaceflight, but they were very advanced in biotech. That very advancement led to their own demise: They uplifted the apparent ancestors of today's §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! as a slave race, which then promptly revolted. The §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! nearly drove their former masters extinct, with only a few Ozari finding shelter in this underground facility.\n\nIt may not have ended well for the Ozari, but our scientists see great potential in the fragments of the technology that we have uncovered."
 mem_sleepers.6.a:0 "Another technological breakthrough. Good work!"
 
 #Some sleepers awake and attack your looting team (small explosion) Scientist dies
 mem_sleepers.7.name:0 "From the Grave"
 mem_sleepers.7.desc:0 "As our science team was busy dismantling the facility, a hidden failsafe mechanism must have awakened some of the sleepers. They were none too pleased about our team's work and a firefight broke out. Our superior firepower turned the tide of battle quickly... but not quickly enough.\n\nRealizing their impending doom, the last remains of the sleepers initiated the vault's self-destruct mechanism, taking our team - including our chief scientist - with them.\n\nA massive underground explosion ripped through the crust of §Y[From.From.From.From.GetName]§!, sending ash and rocks into the atmosphere with power rivalling a supervolcano eruption. There is nothing left of the vault complex.\n\nOur observation post reports that natives who witnessed the incident are astonished by the catastrophe, and local cultures are experiencing a surge of spirituality born out of fear of the gods' wrath."

Our team hurries to the council chambers, where leaders of the sleeper society resided; they arrive to find the aliens in rapid discussion. Their language is unambiguously related to the language spoken by the local primitives, and it takes only a few sentences to establish translation and communication."

Instead, we mastered biology and genetics, culminating in the uplift of a fellow species on our homeworld, the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, to serve as soldiers, laborers, and one day, we hoped, equals. Yet the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! did not see the world as we did, and although scientific knowledge had been largely withheld from our young cousins, they found strength in numbers. The resulting war drove us to the brink of extinction, and we, the last survivors of our people, sought refuge in this vault."

 mem_sleepers.51.desc:0 "The §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! might have lost most of the technology their former masters had, but they did not forget those who first gave them sentience. Their memory lived on as myths and legends of gods, betrayed by their ungrateful ancestors.\n\nOnce the §YOzari§! revealed themselves, the §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! rejoiced at their benefactors returning from the grave. Their bond was forged anew, and leaders of both species promised to never repeat the mistakes of the past. Now they hail us, wishing to discuss their relationship with our empire."

 mem_sleepers.101.desc:0 "The §Y[mem_sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! might once have been able to drive the civilization that uplifted them to near extinction, but they no longer possess the power their ancestors had. What technology they had was lost in time, and without the guiding hand of their former masters they were forced to build their own civilization from scratch.\n\nWith their nearly non-existent technology, they were no match for the §YOzari§! weapons stockpile. Gliders and drone strikes killed most of the primitives within days, leaving the reawakened §YOzari§! as sole masters of §Y[From.From.From.From.From.GetName]§!. Their leader is now hailing us, wishing to discuss their relationship with our empire."

 mem_sleepers.195.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the reactor rapidly failed. We were able to direct just enough of its collapsing energy to revive a single pod. Our scientists rushed to the pod and found an alien who appears to wear leadership regalia.\n\nWe have established communications, which proved to be a fairly trivial task as the leader's language is closely related to multiple languages spoken by contemporary natives. More challenging was the severe distress apparent even across species lines when we said that we had been unable to save any others. But now we believe this sole survivor is ready to talk."
