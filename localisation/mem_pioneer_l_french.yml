 # Anomaly Success
 mem_pioneer.1.name:0 "Extrasolar Probe"
 mem_pioneer.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] reports the successful recovery of the object. On examination, it appears to be a weathered primitive craft designed for unmanned travel between stars. In all likelihood, it was launched millennia ago and traveled through multiple systems at sublight speed until it was caught in [From.GetName]'s gravity. \n\nA plaque is mounted on the craft's hull, depicting odd geometric shapes, a scheme of an unidentified star system and a pictogram of two nude members of a species unknown to us. Why any civilization would see fit to disseminate such information throughout the universe is unclear."
 mem_pioneer.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_pioneer.1.b:0 "They obviously want to be found!"
 mem_pioneer.1.c:0 "What a bunch of degenerates."
 
 mem_pioneer.2.name:0 "Cargo Ship"
 mem_pioneer.2.desc:0 "The small craft recovered by the [Root.GetName] turned out to be some kind of alien commercial courier ship. \n\nCrewed by two unidentified organics and a crude chemically-powered synthetic, it was apparently transporting precious cargo when it was ambushed by pirates. \n\nThe crew seems to have perished in the attack. As the assailants made away with the cargo, the ship was left to drift aimlessly until it was caught by the gravity of the star."
 
 mem_pioneer.3.name:0 "Light Military Vessel"
 mem_pioneer.3.desc:0 "According to [Leader.GetName]'s estimation, the ship found by the [Root.GetName] was a military vessel crewed by several distinct, unidentified species. \n\nAccording to surviving databanks, it was carrying valuable intelligence that would be instrumental in securing a military victory against some kind of "rebels" when it was ambushed in close proximity to [From.GetName]. \n\nAn ill-timed solar flare caused fires all over the ship which the crew tried to put out by depressurizing it, only to find that their airlock control and life support system had been damaged by said fires. Unable to repressurize, the crew perished, leaving the husk of their ship to drift aimlessly around the star."
 
 mem_pioneer.4.name:0 "Life Pod"
 mem_pioneer.4.desc:0 "The craft that the [Root.GetName] recovered appears to be some kind of small life pod carrying mummified remains of an alien youngling. \n\nIt appears that the pod was sent from an unknown planet towards another one, presumably to escape some kind of cataclysm and give its passenger a chance to live on an alien planet. \n\nInstead, the pod was caught by the star's gravity and has orbited it ever since, while the life support system eventually failed. \n\n[Leader.GetName] noted an unusual genetic makeup of the passenger. Had it survived and matured, it could potentially have become one of the strongest and most resilient organics known to our scientists, even without any kind of augmentation."
 mem_pioneer.4.a:0 "One less threat to worry about."
 
 mem_pioneer.5.name:0 "Individual Travel Machine"
 mem_pioneer.5.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] is not quite sure what [Leader.GetSheHe] recovered from the orbit of [From.GetName], but it appears to be some kind of sealed, self-propelling conical capsule made of an extremely durable material. \n\nOther unusual elements include a single optical sensor on a forward-facing stalk, a single forward-facing gun and a manipulator of a sort. Inside, the capsule apparently contained a tiny pilot compartment fit for some kind of small multi-armed being. \n\nAt some point in the past, it was apparently attacked, and a powerful blast hit the sensor. The impact proved fatal to the pilot, who died instantly."
 mem_pioneer.5.a:0 "Whatever it was, it's dead now."

 # Anomaly Failure
 mem_pioneer.99.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_pioneer.99.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] regrets to inform that [Leader.GetSheHe] [Leader.GetWasWere] unable to locate and recover the object. Whatever it might be, it is likely now lost forever."
