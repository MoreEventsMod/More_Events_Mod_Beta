 mem_subspace_beacon_category:0 "Mysterious Beacon"
 mem_subspace_beacon_category_desc:0 "The asteroid §Y[Root.GetName]§! seems to be harbouring some kind of beacon. A consistently repeating subspace ping can be found emanating from its general location at random times, somewhere in the swirling masses of smaller asteroids surrounding the primary one."
 mem_subspace_beacon.1.name:0 "Micro Black Hole"
 mem_subspace_beacon.1.desc:0 "The unusual signals coming from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have been tracked to a miraculously small black hole, no more than a few kilometres across. Minor asteroids, some no larger than fruit, are regularly sucked past the event horizon. This creates subspace disturbances that, according to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, occur due to the black hole's size. Considering its unusual location, it is highly likely the anomaly was purposefully created for some unknown purpose. Whatever it is, it's worth studying further."
 mem_subspace_beacon.11.name:0 "Automated Broadcast"
 mem_subspace_beacon.11.desc:0 "According to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!'s report, the mystery signal from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! originates from a small object embedded in the surface of the asteroid. The object is of alien make, and at irregular intervals broadcasts a subspace signal to several Lagrange points within the system.\n\nThis signal, when decoded, seems to display an automatically created holovid program for some long gone alien race. Each episode is anywhere from one to three hours long, and is a self-contained story set in one of many time periods its creators seem to have gone through, the most advanced being just a few centuries more progressed than our own civilization. As the programs vary wildly in tone, genre, setting, and plot structure, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has theorized the anomaly was built to procedurally generate such programs. Further study could yield valuable insight into both the alien race's society and our own conceptions about what makes a good story."
 mem_subspace_beacon.21.name:0 "Nanobot Asteroid"
 mem_subspace_beacon.21.desc:0 "It would appear that the \"asteroid\" of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is not an asteroid at all, but rather a highly advanced swarm of nanobots. While the exact creator of the swarm is unknown, its purpose has been fairly easily deduced; by sending out a subspace signal, the swarm can detect the echoes of whatever object is present in the system, recording any ships in the vicinity. Whether this was - or maybe even still is - used for surveillance, research, or some other purpose is unknown, but what is known is that in order to maintain secrecy, the nanobots adopt the guise of an unassuming asteroid. Any disturbances on the surface by collisions are automatically repaired by the swarm, before they continue their passive surveillance of the system. By launching missiles and various other objects at §Y[From.GetName]§!, we can watch the nanobots go about their work of repairing the \"asteroid\", giving us a glimpse of nanorobotics far advanced beyond our current understanding of them."
 mem_subspace_beacon.100.name:0 "Subspace Anomaly"
 mem_subspace_beacon.100.desc:0 "The subspace signals originating from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! appear to be originating from nowhere at all. They spontaneously generate from the exact centre of the asteroid, and §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has been unable to find anything out of the ordinary in the region. While certainly fascinating, the signals could easily be replicated in a laboratory, and with no culprit in sight, it looks as if the asteroid has no more secrets to give up."
 mem_subspace_beacon.100.a:0 "Some things are just beyond our current understanding"
 mem_subspace_beacon.150.name:0 "Abandoned Mining Drones"
 mem_subspace_beacon.150.desc:0 "It would appear as though the subspace pings from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! were emanating from some kind of automatic mining station deep under the asteroid's surface. The beacon is an emergency signal, requesting aid from one of the station's allies. Unfortunately, the §Y[Root.Owner.GetName]§! is not one of these allies, and the station and its drones are equipped with weapons to defend their resource extraction operation. They have already opened fire on the §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
