 mem_stuck_in_glacier_category:0 "Stuck in a Glacier"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier_desc:0 "A small foreign object detected within a glacier on the planet's surface."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10.name:0 "Kinetic Projectile"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10.desc:0 "Preliminary observation has identified the object as a large kinetic artillery round, apparently shot at the planet in the distant past. Evidently, some ship launched it from high orbit, causing it to penetrate about 50 meters of ice before stopping. The technology that allowed the object to survive the impact might prove to be useful."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10a:0 "Find a way to recover the object."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.10b:0 "We are not drilling a glacier for a piece of junk."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20.name:0 "Robot"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20.desc:0 "It appears a robotic unit of some sort was embedded within the glacier. Judging by the melting and freezing patterns on the glacial surface, the robotic unit was thrown from the planet's high orbit. It was evidently able to penetrate deep within the glacier with the energy from the impact velocity and the heat from entry through the thin but prevalent atmosphere."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20a:0 "We should attempt to recover it."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20b:0 "We are not drilling a glacier for a piece of junk."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.20c:0 "Let the abominable machine lie dead."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30.name:0 "Dead Explorer"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30.desc:0 "The object that our sensors picked up turned out to be a sealed exo-suit with its occupant, a member of a species unknown to us, still inside. Judging by the damage sustained by the suit, someone had repeatedly bashed the suit's visor with a large rock until its integrity was compromised, and after its user suffocated, threw the body into a crevasse. Recovering the suit and the corpse could prove to be extremely useful for us."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30a:0 "At least someone could now tell their story."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.30b:0 "Looks like the xeno will be of some use after all."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40.name:0 "Crashed Supply Shuttle"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] was surprised to report that the object found on site is one of our own supply shuttles. This particular shuttle had went off the grid a few months ago during a scheduled flight. The flight recorder in the cockpit contains a message from the pilot where he blames [Owner.GetAdj] society's lack of appreciation for him and [Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Owner.GetRulerName]'s conspiracy to persecute him as the main reasons to steal and crash the shuttle."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40a:0 "Tragic."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.40b:0 "What a waste of government property."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.50.name:0 "A Meteorite"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.50.desc:0 "The team sent on site has found a lump of meteorite iron inside the glacier. Judging by its composition, it might be extragalactic in origin, travelling for aeons until being caught in the planet's gravity and eventually crashing on its surface, remaining shallowly buried for some further aeons."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.50a:0 "Such is the great journey of life."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.60.name:0 "Data Cache"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.60.desc:0 "Our deep scans have successfully penetrated the ice, revealing distinct circuitry within the object. Apparently, someone melted a spot in the glacier, placed a protective casing containing a navigational computer in that spot, and let the water re-freeze. Whatever data is hidden there is likely valuable."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.60a:0 "It could be useful."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.99.name:0 "Just a Rock"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.99.desc:0 "The "object" detected within the planet's glacier was revealed to be a simple boulder. Its unusual shape and composition produced abnormal readings, but it is of no interest beyond that."

 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_PROJECTILE_PROJECT:0 "Recover Kinetic Projectile from the Glacier"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_PROJECTILE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A stray orbital shot penetrated the planetary glacier and is currently embedded at about 50 meters deep. We could melt the ice and recover it for studies, but it will take time."
 
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_ROBOT_PROJECT:0 "Recover a Robot from the Glacier"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_ROBOT_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Somebody dumped a robot on a frozen planet. We could cut it out of the ice, but it will take time.\n\nAdvancement in §Yrobotic technology§! would improve our chances at recovering the robot in one piece."
 
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_CACHE_PROJECT:0 "Recover the Glacier Cache"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_CACHE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Somebody has deliberately placed an object deep within a glacier. We should find a way to cut it out."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.11.name:0 "Successful Recovery: Worthless Find"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.11.desc:0 "After the long and difficult dig, [Leader.GetName] reports that the round was not of any value. All design solutions that we could potentially copy are already available to us."

 mem_stuck_in_glacier.12.name:0 "Successful Recovery: Reinforced Rounds"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.12.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] has successfully recovered and examined the projectile. It appears to utilize some unusual layered composition that allows it better penetration and increased impact energy."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.12a:0 "Good job."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13.name:0 "Successful Recovery: High Caliber"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13.desc:0 "Upon recovery and examination, it seems the high caliber of the round is its most notable feature. It suggests certain solutions to weapon technology that might open up new possibilities for extra heavy weaponry."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13a:0 "Good job."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.13b:0 "We have already mastered this technology."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.21.name:0 "Successful Recovery: Robot is Badly Damaged"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.21.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetHerHis] team's lack of familiarity with alien technology has caused irreparable damage during the recovery operation. The unit is now only good for scrap metal."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.21a:0 "Scrap metal it is, then."
 
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.22.name:0 "Successful Recovery: Robot is Functional"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.22.desc:0 "The recovered robot appears to be fully functional and highly sophisticated. Its personality matrix could be reprogrammed to serve our empire's needs with only a handful of adjustments."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.22a:0 "Bring it Online."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.22a.tooltip:0 "The robot will be activated to serve as a §Yleader§! for your empire."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.22b:0 "Scrap it for components instead."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.61.name:0 "Treasure Map"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.61.desc:0 "It seems some unknown space pirate has hidden this data here in case they ever need a bargaining chip. It contains a set of coordinates that should lead us to a hidden treasure."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.61a:0 "Follow the map!"
 
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_MAP_PROJECT:0 "Follow the Coordinates"
 MEM_STUCK_IN_GLACIER_MAP_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Data recovered from the computer points towards a nearby planet. We should follow the coordinates and see if there's anything of value"
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.62.name:0 "Nothing Recovered"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.62.desc:0 "After following the coordinates, we found a vault concealed on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. However, whatever was once hidden here was long since removed by someone else. The vault is empty."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.62a:0 "What a waste of time."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.63.name:0 "Hidden Valuables"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.63.desc:0 "We discovered a vault concealed on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. Vast deposits of valuable items have been recovered by our specialists."
 
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.64.name:0 "Hidden Hangar"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.64.desc:0 "What [Leader.GetName] found following pirate's coordinates was not a vault, but a hangar hiding a massive pirate ship. Its state-of-the-art equipment could be quite an asset to our military forces."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.64a:0 "Bring it online"
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.64a.tooltip:0 "A §Ypirate cruiser§! will be recovered to serve as part of your navy."
 mem_stuck_in_glacier.64b:0 "This ship is more use to us as scrap metal."
