 #Anomaly
 mem_defying_gravity_category:0 "Defying Gravity"
 mem_defying_gravity_category_desc:0 "We are detecting some kind of object hovering above [Root.GetName] at an altitude from which, by our understanding of physics, it should have crashed onto the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface long ago."

 #Events
 mem_defying_gravity.100.name:0 "Phantom Readings"
 mem_defying_gravity.100.desc:0 "After a repeat investigation, [Root.GetName] reports that the strange object supposedly "hovering" above [From.GetName] is actually the result of an improper reading of the sensors. \n\nSeemingly, static electricity in the atmosphere is throwing off our calibrations, resulting in phantom objects appearing on some scans. Despite overall disappointment, this is still an interesting phenomenon worth studying."
 mem_defying_gravity.100.a:0 "A bit anticlimactic."

 mem_defying_gravity.200.name:0 "Advertising Blimp"
 mem_defying_gravity.200.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that the mysterious object found hovering above [From.GetName] is, in fact, a brightly illuminated platform, suspended via anti-gravity and broadcasting what seems to be commercial information. \n\nPreliminary analysis suggests that the platform is over 2000 years old. Whoever built it is probably long dead, but the message about their generous discount on moochwazarxes remains eternal."
 mem_defying_gravity.200.a:0 "What is a moochwazarx anyway?"
 mem_defying_gravity.200.a.tooltip:1 "Extra $job_culture_worker$ and $job_researcher$ vacancies added to [From.GetName]."
 mem_defying_gravity.200.burden:1 "What a depraved symbol of consumerist decadence!"
 mem_defying_gravity.200.burden.tooltip:1 "Unimpressed by advertising, we will not get extra $job_culture_worker$ jobs from it."
 mem_defying_gravity.200.corp:1 "We should learn all we can from their techniques."
 mem_defying_gravity.200.corp.tooltip:1 "Compared to others, Megacorporations receive one extra $job_culture_worker$ job from it."
 mem_defying_gravity.200.gest:1 "What is "advertisement" exactly?"

 mem_defying_gravity.300.name:0 "Suspended Asteroid"
 mem_defying_gravity.300.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that the strange object suspended over [From.GetName] is, in fact, a completely mundane asteroid. \n\nThe odd thing is located right below it - a massive complex emitting some kind of beam that keeps the asteroid from falling onto the surface. The complex appears to be completely autonomous and no other signs of advanced life have been detected on the planet."
 mem_defying_gravity.300.a:0 "Who built it here? And why?"
 mem_defying_gravity.300.a.tooltip:0 "$d_mem_defying_gravity_field_generator_deposit$"

 mem_defying_gravity.301.name:0 "Unsuspended"
 mem_defying_gravity.301.desc:0 "Due to deactivation of the $d_mem_defying_gravity_field_generator_deposit$ on [Root.GetName], the asteroid above it continued its voyage unimpeded and crashed into the planet, leaving massive crater."
 mem_defying_gravity.301.a:0 "Oh well..."
 mem_defying_gravity.301.a.tooltip:0 "The surface of [Root.GetName] gets a new £blocker  Crater."

 mem_defying_gravity.400.name:0 "Sea's Shadow"
 mem_defying_gravity.400.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports something truly bizarre. \n\nIt appears the suspended object above [From.GetName] is not an object at all. \n\nIt is, in fact, an optical illusion caused by a flat "sea" of exotic particles covering parts of the planet. Somehow it creates an illusory sphere hovering above the largest concentration. \n\nThe exotic particles should not impede life on the surface but will likely provide a lot of data on forms of exotic matter."
 mem_defying_gravity.400.a:0 "This definitely warrants a study."

 #Modifiers
 mem_defying_gravity_strange_thing:0 "Sea's Shadow"
 mem_defying_gravity_strange_thing_desc:0 "The planet is littered with regions covered with exotic matter, reflecting in the sky above as a giant ball."

 static_planet_resource_society_research_add:0 "Monthly Society Research" #Seems there's nothing in vanilla files to copy from, but this sounds about right.

 #Ambient Objects
 mem_defying_gravity_blimp:0 "Advertising Blimp"
 mem_defying_gravity_asteroid:0 "Suspended Asteroid"

 #Deposit
 d_mem_defying_gravity_field_generator_deposit:0 "Suspension Field Generator"
 d_mem_defying_gravity_field_generator_deposit_desc:0 "A mysterious construction generating a directed suspension field, preventing a large asteroid from falling on the surface. \n\n§RRemoving it would likely cause asteroid to continue its fall.§!"
 d_mem_defying_gravity_blimp_deposit:0 "Advertising Blimp"
 d_mem_defying_gravity_blimp_deposit_desc:0 "A small station is hovering over this planet, broadcasting important information regarding discounted moochwazarxes."
