 mem_hidden_tundra_category_desc:0 "Chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! had some interesting readings on the planet §Y[From.GetName]§!. A closer investigation seems warranted"

 mem_hidden_tundra.1.name:0 "It's a Habitable Planet!"
 mem_hidden_tundra.1.desc:0 "It turns out that planet §Y[From.GetName]§! is not barren as our first scans showed, but actually a tundra world. It still appears to be a pretty bleak planet though. It has an almost featureless surface and next to no plant life, but should still be colonizable given light local terraforming efforts. We should also establish a research outpost to learn how life on such a planet is even possible."

 mem_hidden_tundra.2.name:0 "A Barren Uninteresting Rock in Space"
 mem_hidden_tundra.2.desc:0 "Contrary to first assumptions of §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, §Y[From.GetName]§! is just a dead, boring rock in space. We should focus our research efforts elsewhere."
