mem_we_are_gods.2.name:0 "We are gods?"
mem_we_are_gods.2.desc:0 "It seems the natives of this planet have come to believe we are... gods. This left us in a very awkward spot when one of our research teams got caught and the natives fell on their knees instead of attacking the team. Religion surrounding us, including some that refer to us as those that will "ascend them to a higher plane of existence", are on a steady rise throughout their society. It does make it easier to abduct natives for further study though, given they basically offer themselves."

mem_we_are_gods.3.a:0 "Intriguing."
mem_we_are_gods.3.b:0 "Anything but a status of gods is too low when comparing those wretched creatures to us."
mem_we_are_gods.3.c:0 "At least they are on the right path… somewhat."
