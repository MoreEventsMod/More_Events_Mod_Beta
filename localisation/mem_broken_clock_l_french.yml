 mem_broken_clock.1.desc:0 "The §Y[From.GetName] System§! is a strange place. \n\nOrbiting a long-dead star is a massive ancient ring world. Despite the obvious damage sustained by it over the years, very few debris are visible. The other unusual sight is a multitude of shrouded bodies, a planet and a several moons covered by an impenetrable purple haze. \n\nBut most importantly, the system is affected by bizarre time dilation effects that do not seem to correspond with the known principles of general relativity and create pockets of distorted time across the system. \n\nBesides affecting our perception of time, they seem harmless. Yet something is clearly very wrong with this place..."

 mem_broken_clock.1001.desc:0 "A bizarre occurrence in the §Y[From.Solar_System.GetName]§! System has been reported. [Root.MemBrokenClock1001] mysterious fog shrouding the planets has vanished, revealing the planets' surfaces. The massive ringworld structure seems to have somehow repaired all the damage sustained. Even the star itself has changed its composition and turned into a bright A-class star, seemingly reversing billions of years of aging. \n\nMost strangely, the desolate system is now teeming with life. Sprawling cities and industrial areas cover the ringworld and one of the larger planets, along with two fully developed habitats that simply appeared out of the void, guarded by massive fleets. It's as if the system had never been deserted. \n\nThe mysterious newcomers are hailing us."

Our sacred mission is to cleanse the universe of impure and abominable alien life. \n\nIn a different age, the treachery of our enemies left us trapped in a temporal pocket. But an eternity spent among crumbling realities and broken timelines has only strengthen our resolve. \n\nFight us or submit to your fate, it matters not. Your destruction is inevitable."

Stronger adversaries tried to resist us, but all they could do is temporarily trap us. \n\nThe eternity spent in the temporal bubble has only increased our hunger. Now we are free and ready for another hunt."

It's not clear what was the cause of such turn of events, but it is likely that whatever temporal event brought them here has been reverted or failed.
