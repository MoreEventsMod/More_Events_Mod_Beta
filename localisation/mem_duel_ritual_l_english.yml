 mem_duel_ritual.4.desc:0 "Although most of the populace of §Y[This.GetName]§! have come to terms with their new lot in life, a particularly militaristic faction has been stirring up unrest at their loss of independance.

 # Audience Duel proposal
 mem_duel_ritual.6.name:0 "Archaic Rituals"
 mem_duel_ritual.6.desc:0 "The representative explains: "The people of §Y[This.GetName]§! have a long tradition of settling social matters such as this through the means of honour duels. Representatives of our two peoples would engage in combat armed with only primitive weapons. Although these duels are mostly symbolic, this symbolism is of great importance to our people.\n\nIf you accept this proposal all hostilities will cease immediatly until the ritual is over. What do you say?""
 mem_duel_ritual.6.a:0 "We accept. General [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] will be our champion."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.a.tooltip:0 "General §Y[mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName]§! "volunteers" to act as your champion in the duel."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.a.response:0 ""It is settled then. Your champion will face ours in a month from now."\n\nBoth combatants will take this time to prepare. It is unlikely that this highly ritualised duel will prove fatal to either, but accidents do happen..."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.b:0 "We accept. A member of our special forces will be our champion."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.b.tooltip:0 "A volunteer from the special forces division will act as your champion in the duel."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.c:0 "We will not participate in this archaic ritual."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.c.tooltip:0 "As a result of your refusal to honour their customs all primitive pops on §Y[This.GetName]§! will get a stronger version of the §YForeign Occupation§! modifier reducing their happiness by 20% for five years."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.c.response:0 ""This is outrageous! Our people will never accept your rule while you utterly disregard our traditions!"\n\nThe representative storms out of the room..."

 mem_duel_ritual.7.desc_01:0 "The day has arrived. In front of a baying crowd and an eager audience watching the live broadcast of this historic event across our empire's space the two opponents enter the ancient arena. The sands of this place have soaked up the blood of the [mem_duel_ritual_species.GetSpeciesName] across the ages. Whether our race will leave stains too is to be seen.\n\nBefore their current commanding position, General [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] was a member of our special forces, with over 300 confirmed kills. As a former expert in guerilla warfare, they are no stranger to melee combat. As the hour approaches, hurried words, possibly final, are exchanged between family members, whilst the pundits scramble to place final bets. A hush grows as the combatants walk forward and salute."

 mem_duel_ritual.8.name:0 "A Decisive Victory"
 mem_duel_ritual.8.desc:0 "General [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] is victorious! This battle was decided almost from the first blow, which struck the other champion to the ground. The population of §Y[mem_duel_ritual_planet.GetName]§! have accepted this clear sign of our martial superiority and embraced our society with open arms. There are likely to be no future issues."
 mem_duel_ritual.8.a:0 "As it should be."

 # General Fight Draw
 mem_duel_ritual.9.name:0 "A Draw?"
 mem_duel_ritual.9.desc:0 "As both combatants closed upon one another, general [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] and their opponent tripped over their own appendages, knocking themselves unconsious on a rock on the ground. On the brighter side, the militant movement that started all this trouble seems to have fizzled out due to a complete inability to comprehend what just happened. The rest of the galaxy comprehends well enough though, their mocking laugther echoing through our ears. The general's pride will never recover, and with good reason."
 mem_duel_ritual.9.a:0 "We are the laughing stock of the galaxy!"
 mem_duel_ritual.9.a.tooltip:0 "Removes the §YForeign Occupation§! and instead adds the §YImpressed by Duel§! modifier to all primitives on §Y[mem_duel_ritual_planet.GetName]§! increasing their happiness.

The video of both combatants realising the extent of their injuries and each managing to salute their rival before collapsing to the ground has been seen throughout the empire. The population of §Y[mem_duel_ritual_planet.GetName]§! seem to view this mutual sign of respect by both mortally wounded combatants with great reverence."
