 # Events
 mem_sadrell.2.name: "The Orphan Gate"
 mem_sadrell.2.desc: "We have encountered an unusual §Sgateway§! in the §Y[From.GetName]§! system. \n\nIt bears strong marks of tampering and deliberate alterations that seem to have permanently disabled its ability to connect with other parts of gateway network. Theoretically, it should be able to connect to one specific gate, however all data related to such a connection has been wiped from the gate's control system. \n\nIf it can be opened, it must be done from the other side."
 
 mem_sadrell.101.name: "The Orphan Gate"
 mem_sadrell.101.desc: "We are observing strange activity within the §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! system. \n\nThe previously inert gateway stationed there is starting to show signs of activity. Even though it has not yet established a stable connection, we are receiving a signal from the other side. It seems to be meant specifically for us."

 mem_sadrell.104.desc: "Our remote tracking systems have detected unusual activity within the §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! system. \n\nThe previously inert gateway stationed there has been reactivated, opening the pathway to a previously inaccessible star cluster outside of the main galaxy's space. Said cluster appears to host an advanced civilization that is now claiming several unclaimed star systems in the vicinity. They are hailing us."
 mem_sadrell.110.desc: "Hello. Are you receiving? Good. \n\nI am speaking on behalf of the [newcomer_country.GetName], the last survivors of the once proud Sadrell species. \n\nOur civilization has been struggling ever since we were forced to flee the galaxy through what you call the "§SOrphan Gate§!". In our current state, we can no longer maintain our isolation and will have to take the risk and return to the galaxy our ancestors abandoned 600 years ago. We have exhausted all our options, colonizing hostile environments and settling void habitats; §Swe have augmented ourselves with cybernetics just to survive the harsh conditions§!. \n\nWhat you need to know is that we consider every system within §S2§! hyperlane jumps of §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! as our essential core territory. That includes some systems you had claimed for yourselves. \n\nWe humbly request that you return our ancestral lands, in the name of lasting galactic peace."
 mem_sadrell.110.a: "Very well. We will cede our territory."
 mem_sadrell.110.b: "No way. You will get nothing from us."
 mem_sadrell.110.c: "We could share our land... with a loyal vassal."
 mem_sadrell.110.d: "We can share this territory as members of a federation."
 mem_sadrell.110.e: "Perhaps you could join our federation in exchange?"
 mem_sadrell.110.f: "Why did you abandon the galaxy?"
 mem_sadrell.110.f.response: "We were once part of the great §YUnited Sadrell Republic§!. Centuries ago, we were a major player on galactic arena. Dozens of planets and a myriad of species worked together for a greater future. It seemed that nothing could end our golden age. \n\nBut our civilisation was more fragile than we had imagined. Prosperity brought complacency, complacency brought rigidity and stagnation. One major economic recession followed another until entire worlds found themselves on the brink of famine and civil war. Our central government could not resolve the situation - it often seemed to not even try to do so. \n\nEventually, order broke down. Old rivalries rekindled. Skirmishes and pirate raids turned into a full-blown ever-escalating war. When the conflict approached the core worlds, some thought the Republic to be beyond saving. The recently activated gateway offered a sanctuary for a large number of refugees, who sealed the gates behind themselves in order to shut off the crisis permanently. \n\nSome might call them cowards and say that they should've stayed and fought for their home. But we are alive, and the others are not. That's all the evidence needed."
 mem_sadrell.110.g: "Did you modify the gateway?"
 mem_sadrell.110.g.response: "No. We found it like this. \n\nIt seems to be an experiment of a sort, an attempt to branch out from the mainstream hyperlane network. Maybe whoever did this sought sanctuary, maybe they sought new resources. Maybe they just wanted to do it because they could. \n\nOur ancestors had only just figured out how the gateways worked when the crisis came. It seems that nobody had been through them for thousands of years before we came."

 mem_sadrell.112.pac: "How horrible."
 mem_sadrell.114.desc: "I see. \n\nIt seems that we don't have much choice. \n\nTo go to war with you would be a grave mistake, and we don't have a future in this galaxy if we can't even return to our homes... We accept your terms."
 mem_sadrell.115.desc: "In the golden age of the United Sadrell Republic, a galactic federation was a dream worth pursuing. \n\nIt is a small step, but a great symbol of returning of our past glory. We accept your offer."

 mem_sadrell.116.desc: "I see. Attitudes like this are why we sealed ourselves from the galaxy to begin with. \n\nA shame. Looks like the galaxy has not changed in our absence. But it is too late to turn back. We will fight for our future."

 mem_sadrell.116.swarm: "HAK! HAK! HAK!"
 mem_sadrell.120.desc: "This is an interesting proposition, I can't deny it. \n\nJoining an existing federation would be tricky. I hope your allies will support your generosity."

 mem_sadrell.121.desc: "The §Y[From.GetName]§! has recently been contacted by a foreign power that has emerged from a gateway in the [gate_system.GetName] system. The Sadrell are descendants of refugees that were forced to adopt §Scybernetic technology§! and other desperate methods just to survive the unfriendly environment away from home. \n\nThe [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are considering returning some former Sadrell territory in exchange for their support for our federation, but they need our approval to finalize the deal."

 mem_sadrell.124.desc: "It seems like your proposition has failed. This leaves us in a rather awkward situation... \n\nWe can't join the [Root.GetAllianceName], so where do we go from here?"
 mem_sadrell.124.a: "We will start our own federation!"
 mem_sadrell.124.b: "We will cede the systems unconditionally."
 mem_sadrell.124.c: "In this case, you get nothing."
 mem_sadrell.130.desc: "We are the Sadrell.

We have exhausted all our options, colonizing hostile environments and settling void habitats; §Swe have augmented ourselves with cybernetics just to survive the harsh conditions§!. \n\nNow, we have no choice but to unseal our cluster and return.
