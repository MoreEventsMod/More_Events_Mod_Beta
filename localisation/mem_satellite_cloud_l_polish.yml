  #Base
  mem_satellite_cloud_category:0 "Satellite Cloud"
  mem_satellite_cloud_category_desc:0 "Our sensors have detected the presence of multiple solid structures in close proximity to the star §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Further scans are necessary."

  #Failure 1
  mem_satellite_cloud.201.name:0 "Observation Failed"
  mem_satellite_cloud.201.desc:0 "Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that although artificial objects are undoubtedly present within the star's corona, strong gravitational and electro-magnetic interference from the star makes observing, let alone salvaging the objects, completely impossible. The mysterious objects are likely forever outside our grasp."

  #Failure 2
  mem_satellite_cloud.202.name:0 "Failed Retrieval"
  mem_satellite_cloud.202.desc:0 "Initial reports from Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reveal hundreds of satellites orbiting the star. However, as the §Y[Root.GetName]§! approached, it appears to have tripped some kind of proximity sensor, causing the entire satellite cloud to turn on their manoeuvring thrusters and plummet into the star's corona. Even if the satellites are somehow able to survive the inferno inside the star, they are now completely beyond our ability to recover them."

  #Critical Failure 1
  mem_satellite_cloud.301.name:0 "Observation Critically Failed"
  mem_satellite_cloud.301.desc:0 "Our ship, while investigating the solid structures orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§!, tried to retrieve the objects nearest the star's corona, and in an attempt to do so, it flew too close to the star and was destroyed. The mysterious objects are likely forever outside our grasp."

  #Critical Failure 2
  mem_satellite_cloud.302.name:0 "Unmanned Drones Awakened"
  mem_satellite_cloud.302.desc:0 "We have received a distress signal from §Y[Root.GetName]§!. The objects it was sent to observe turned out to be a swarm of unmanned drones, lying dormant in the sun's corona. Triggered by our ship's approach, they are reactivating and are assuming combat positions."
  mem_satellite_cloud.retreat:0 "Retreat!"

  #Art Installation
  mem_satellite_cloud.1.name:0 "Art Installation"
  mem_satellite_cloud.1.desc:0 "Hundreds of prismatic objects, each having a unique shape and structure, have been placed around the star, allowing starlight to pass through them to be dispersed in unusual spectral patterns. Most of the prisms appear to have been knocked out of alignment over time, but even what little still remains can only be described as \"mesmerising.\""

  #Solarium
  mem_satellite_cloud.2.name:0 "Solarium"
  mem_satellite_cloud.2.desc:0 "Our observation revealed hundreds of habitat satellites suspended over §Y[From.GetName]§! via advanced solar sails. A notable feature of each of them is a transparent dome turned towards the star, suggesting incredible heat tolerance. Now abandoned and seemingly falling apart, these satellites cannot be safely recovered. However, our scientists should be able to extract useful structural data via remote scans."

  #Cloud Computing
  mem_satellite_cloud.3.name:0 "Cloud Computing"
  mem_satellite_cloud.3.desc:0 "After thorough scans, our science team reports the presence of a vast network of advanced energy-scooping satellites orbiting the star. According to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, they appear to be linked with super-tensile fibre-optics, suggesting that the energy they absorbed was intended to be used to perform calculations of some sort. Although these satellites themselves are damaged beyond repair, the technology we discovered has offered us an insight into advanced computation."

  #Observatory
  mem_satellite_cloud.4.name:0 "Observatory"
  mem_satellite_cloud.4.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports hundreds of parabolic antennae orbiting the star §Y[From.GetName]§!, all directed outward. It appears that the satellite cloud channelled enormous amounts of energy from the star to send outbound and process incoming signals. Although damaged beyond repair or recovery, the satellite cloud has provided us with valuable insights into stellar observation techniques."

  #Scrap Metal
  mem_satellite_cloud.5.name:0 "Scrap Metal"
  mem_satellite_cloud.5.desc:0 "A massive cloud of debris orbits the star. Likely they were once a network of satellites, now eroded nearly beyond recognition by the harsh conditions of proximity to the star. But even the mangled husks of this alien technology can be recovered as scrap and processed by our industry."

  #Stellar Converter
  mem_satellite_cloud.6.name:0 "Stellar Converter"
  mem_satellite_cloud.6.desc:0 "Hundreds of solar panels are positioned near the star §Y[From.GetName]§!. They are linked to massive energy converter nodes which seem to have once been used to channel enormous amounts of solar energy elsewhere; however, in their current state they cannot be safely re-activated or recovered. Still, the surviving systems have provided us with valuable insights into advanced energy manipulation."

  #Stellar Scoop
  mem_satellite_cloud.7.name:0 "Stellar Scoop"
  mem_satellite_cloud.7.desc:0 "Our observations revealed hundreds of advanced stations siphoning charged plasma from the star's corona. Deposited in large containers, it was likely supposed to be loaded on ships and delivered to processing centres. Unfortunately, these stations appear to have been left unmaintained for ages, and most of the storage containers are cracked and leaking. The entire system is too unstable to be safely repaired or manipulated. However, the easily accessible plasma will be a boon for our industry."

  #Pyrovore Colony
  mem_satellite_cloud.8.name:0 "Pyrovore Colony"
  mem_satellite_cloud.8.desc:0 "The unknown structures were revealed to be large transparent domes turned towards the star, suggesting they were used as greenhouses or hydroponic labs. Most of them are broken and lifeless, but bizarrely, on some labs, life seems to thrive despite (or perhaps because of) the harsh conditions arising from their close solar proximity. Large colonies of primitive organisms that have somehow adapted to the extreme heat and vacuum of space are covering the hulls of multiple satellites. It would likely be impossible to move samples of these organisms away from the star, but even remote observation will be invaluable for studying their unique adaptations."

  mem_satellite_cloud.dissapointing:0 "Disappointing."
  mem_satellite_cloud.useful:0 "That's useful."
