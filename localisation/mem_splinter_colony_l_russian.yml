After a lenghty search the lost science ship was finally located crash-landed on [mem_splinter_colony.GetName]. However, the crash site, appearing acient at first glance, was later proven to date multiple centuries back.\n\nThe ship's recovered data core revealed what had happened to the vessel and its crew. During its last transmission one of the anomalies, the science ship had previously been tasked with studying, expanded rapidly, seizing the ship before any evasive action could be taken, and forcefully ejected it again shortly thereafter. Heavily damaged it drifted towards [mem_splinter_colony.GetName] crash-landing where our search teams would later find it. According to the data, there was nothing the crew could have done to prevent it."

After a lenghty and unsuccessful search our teams were ready to close the operation, when a sudden energy spike, originating from our lost science ship's last known location, was detected.\n\nWith its engine damaged and disabled the already thought-lost ship had reappeared. Luckily, the search team was still there and able to repair the damage. For the crew hardly any time had passed since they sent their last transmission.\n\nAccording to them, their vessel was caught by one of the anomalies they had been studying, when it suddenly expanded. After a short but rough ride they were ejected, suprised at being greeted by their rescuers the next moment."

What was even more bizarre than the fact that these hadn't been noticed during our earlier survey were its inhabitants. They are [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!\n\nAfter establishing contact our search team learned that the inhabitants were the descendants of a crew of scientists on an exploratory mission who stranded on this planet multiple generations ago. It is quite apparent that their ship was our lost science ship.\n\nDespite the harsh and inhospitable conditions on [mem_splinter_colony.GetName] the survivors had managed endure by cannibalizing the wreckage to create the first of their habitats. Over time their community even grew in numbers.\n\nNonetheless, their living conditions there are far from decent and our search team's offer to transport them to [capital_scope.GetName] was met with open arms."
