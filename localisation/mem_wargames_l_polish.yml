 mem_wargame.1.desc:0 "The trinary §Y[From.GetName] System§! is quite an unusual sight. \n\nLittered with debris, it nevertheless is also filled with life, and multiple planets in the system seem to host primitive civilisations. \n\nWe are detecting an abandoned station orbiting one of the isolated planets, quietly watching over the system."
 mem_wargame.1.a:0 "We should investigate."

 MEM_WARGAME_EXPLORE_STATION:0 "Exploring Abandoned Station"
 MEM_WARGAME_EXPLORE_STATION_DESC:0 "When surveying the §Y[mem_wargame_system.GetName] System§!. we encountered an abandoned station orbiting one of the planets. It might hold interesting information regarding the system's past."

 mem_wargame.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports the successful investigation of a strange station orbiting [mem_wargate_station_planet.GetName]. \n\nJudging by surviving data cores, the system was set up as a massive experiment, or possibly a form of entertainment. \n\nFour species were uplifted by an unknown party, provided with FTL-incapable warships and set to fight each other, while their benefactors could watch from a safely hidden location on the system's outskirts. \n\nThe experiment came to abrupt end when a group of conspirators from all four species infiltrated the station and massacred everyone on board. Strangely, no retaliation followed, and the natives, lacking the practical knowledge required to maintain the technology they had been gifted, soon settled back into primitive life."
