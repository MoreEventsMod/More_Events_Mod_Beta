# Initial Anomaly Appearance:

 mem_giant_tank_category:0 "Strange Hulks"
 mem_giant_tank_category_desc:0 "Our survey team has found some gigantic structures that seem to have been mobile at some point in the distant past. They are located in the middle of a massive battlefield. Radiation levels seem to be low enough to take a closer look."

# Anomaly Investigation Fails:

 mem_giant_tank.1.name:0 "Old Debris"
 mem_giant_tank.1.desc:0 "What seemed to be some great discovery rather quickly became a big disappointment for our scientists. They found nothing but old debris and ruins and had to correct their former statement."
 mem_giant_tank.1.a:0 "Then let's move on."
 
# Anomaly Investigation Succeeds: 
 
 mem_giant_tank.2.name:0 "Giants of the Past"
 mem_giant_tank.2.desc:0 "These massive hulks of steel sitting enthroned above this ancient battlefield are much more advanced than we formerly anticipated this civilisation's technology to be, judging by their seemingly non-existent spacefaring ability. Our team has come to the conclusion that this civilisation was too occupied with waging war against its own kind to reach for the stars.\n\nPowered by nuclear fission reactors, these giants, which [Root.GetLeaderName] estimates to weigh between 10.000 and 15.000 tons, must have rolled over the battlefield like moving mountains. At first, [Root.GetSheHe] thought them to have been large and vulnerable targets, until our science team found two high-powered shield generators deep inside a giant's steel hull. If the assumptions of [Root.GetLeaderName] are correct, they might have not just protected the Land Ship, as it is called by our team, but also entire regiments moving besides them.\n\nThere are some interesting designs that our military cannot wait to get their hands on."
 mem_giant_tank.2.a:0 "Great. Let's get started!"
 
# Tank Investigation Special Project:

 MEM_GIANT_TANK_INVESTIGATION:0 "Machines of War"
 MEM_GIANT_TANK_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "Our Scientists are ready to restore these ancient war machines. All materials and our temporary shelter city are in place and the work can begin."
 
# Tank Investigation Complete - Have Two Tanks:

 mem_giant_tank.11.name:0 "Machines of War"
 mem_giant_tank.11.desc:0 "It took quite some work to restore these ancient mobile fortresses. They are much more advanced than we had anticipated, and we only understand parts of their tech. Thus, we won't be able to replicate such a machine and these two will be all we get. Each one will need its own special transport ship to get it off-world, but aside from this everything is ready for departure."
 mem_giant_tank.11.a:0 "Excellent."
 mem_giant_tank.11.a.tooltip:0 "Gain two Mobile Fortress armies."
 
# Tank Investigation Complete - Neutral:

 mem_giant_tank.12.name:0 "Ancient Machines"
 mem_giant_tank.12.desc:0 "Our team was unable to repair these mobile fortresses. Their technology was even more advanced than we anticipated and thus our attempts were futile.\n\nMaybe it is for the best though, seeing what this civilization brought onto itself while fielding such machines of war. However, we have made some pretty interesting discoveries inside these wreckages that will further our knowledge in engineering."
 mem_giant_tank.12.a:0 "Unfortunate. We could have used them."
 
# Tank Investigation Complete - Disaster:

 mem_giant_tank.13.name:0 "From the Grave"
 mem_giant_tank.13.desc:0 "One of our Scientists made a tragic mistake in reactivating the computer system of one of the mobile fortresses. Its former owners must have feared a possible enemy capture of one of these machines more than anything else, as they implemented drastic measures in its security systems. As our scientists failed to deactivate it, the hulk and our entire science team vanished in a nuclear explosion. They have become the last victims of an unending war."
 mem_giant_tank.13.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
# Giant Tank Armies:

 mem_giant_tank_army:0 "Mobile Fortress"
 mem_giant_tank_army_plural:0 "Mobile Fortresses"
 mem_giant_tank_army_desc:0 "A colossal ground war machine with the firepower of a battleship."
