mem_beached_category_desc: "We are registering a life sign emanating from §Y[This.GetName]§!. The readings are consistent with a Tiyanki space whale but are unusually faint."

 mem_beached.1.name: "Lost Tiyanki"
 mem_beached.1.desc: "Further scans of [From.GetName] reveal a female Tiyanki within a large crevice on the asteroid's surface. The creature has clearly had better days. \n\nAt the moment, she does not respond to anything and appears to be hibernating. Her hide bears considerable scars, suggesting she was at some point attacked and separated from her herd, or is the last surviving member of it. She used the asteroid to hide and recuperate, but her wounds appear to be too severe to heal on their own."
 mem_beached.1.a: "Find a way to help her."
 mem_beached.1.b: "Let the nature take its course."
 mem_beached.1.c: "A perfect opportunity for vivisection."
 mem_beached.1.d: "Fresh meat!"
 mem_beached.2.name: "The Tiyanki Treated"
 mem_beached.2.desc: "Our understanding of Tiyanki anatomy is far from perfect, but §Y[leader.GetName]§! did [Leader.GetHerHis] best. \n\nThe closer examination revealed several heavy metal objects under her hide. They seem to be specifically designed to get lodged inside the space whale's soft tissue, preventing the natural healing process. Once they were discovered, they were not hard to remove, and following a proper cauterization and injection of several tonnes of a synthetic analogue of Tiyanki blood, the creature began to recover rapidly. \n\nHer consciousness regained, the Tiyanki seems to be aware enough of our help that she stays nearby, seemingly gauging the extent of our friendship."
 mem_beached.2.a: "Adopt the Tiyanki."
 mem_beached.2.b: "Let her leave and be free."
 mem_beached.3.name: "Naming the Tiyanki"
 mem_beached.3.desc: "Our newly adopted pet Tiyanki is quite popular among the [Owner.GetAdj] citizens. Many name suggestions have been submitted for her."
 mem_beached_3.no_name: "She doesn't need a name."
 mem_beached_3.flopsy: "Flopsy."
 mem_beached_3.jewel: "Jewel."
 mem_beached_3.candy: "Candy."

 mem_beached_3.salad: "Salad."
 mem_beached.4.name: "[Root.GetName] Gives Birth"
 mem_beached.4.desc: "This reveal caught us by surprise due to our limited understanding of Tiyanki physiology, but [Root.GetName] was apparently gestating all this time. Presumably, the process was suspended when she was wounded and resumed once we treated her, but today she gave birth to three healthy calves. "

 MEM_BEACHED_PROJECT: "Treat the Wounded Tiyanki"
 MEM_BEACHED_PROJECT_DESC: "We might not know much about Tiyanki anatomy, but this one doesn't look too good. We might be able to help her."
