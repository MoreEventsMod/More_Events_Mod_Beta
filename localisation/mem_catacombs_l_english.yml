 mem_catacombs_category_desc:0 "A thorough examination of the planet has found an entrance to a network of tunnels that extend within the planet, possibly built by someone before the planet was rendered uninhabitable."
  
 mem_catacombs.10.name:0 "The Collection"
 mem_catacombs.10.desc:0 "We have managed to explore nearly all of the caverns, and what we have found was unprecedented. \n\nWithin the various vaults and galleries, we have found hundreds of artifacts preserved within an inert atmosphere. The archive potentially contains materials covering hundreds of worlds and cultures, and testing has revealed that several of the artifacts are millions of years old. \n\nThis collection of priceless artifacts could be a boon to researchers studying cultures that have long since gone extinct. However, many collectors are also interested, and are willing to pay large sums for the collection."
 mem_catacombs.10.a:0 "No, we shall study it for ourselves."
 mem_catacombs.10.b:0 "Put a price on it."
 mem_catacombs.10.c:0 "Xeno filth cannot be allowed to contaminate us."
 
 mem_catacombs.11.name:0 "Natural Formations"
 mem_catacombs.11.desc:0 "What seemed upon first analysis to be an artificial network of subterrainean caverns turned out to be nothing of the sort. The caves appear to go deep within the planet, however they offer nothing of value that cannot be found elsewhere under less dangerous conditions."
 mem_catacombs.11.a:0 "Too bad."
  
 mem_catacombs.12.name:0 "Collapse"
 mem_catacombs.12.desc:0 "In the proccess of exploring the caverns, a gallery collapsed on top of §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the team, killing them instantly. A number of researchers were also trapped in the rubble for several days, and nearly all of the artifacts were destroyed either by the collapse or the subsequent search effort. Nothing of value was recovered from the site."
