 mem_hithere.1.name:0 "Strange Signal"
 mem_hithere.1.desc:0 "Our observatory above planet §Y[receiver.GetName]§! has picked up a transmission. Unlike technology currently available to us, it consists of simple electro-magnetic waves that carry information at the speed of light. While the signal is faint from travelling for years through the vast emptiness of space, it is looped, so we should be able to reconstruct and decipher it with ease."
 mem_hithere.1a:0 "They have nothing interesting to say. Delete."
 
 mem_hithere.2.name:0 "Recorded Message"
 mem_hithere.2.desc:0 "Hi there! This is professor Wukka Zaor of the Valintu Extrasolar Intelligence Institute speaking. \n\nWe are sending this message across the galaxy in the hope of reaching our brothers in intelligence. We do not have the technology to travel between the stars, but we hope that you can. \n\nBy the time this message will reach you, all of those who participated in its recording will likely be dead, but we are hopeful that you will honour our descendants with your visit. \n\nI know that our civilization is far from perfect, but still, we hope that we can find ground for mutual understanding and be able to learn from each other. \n\nWe refuse to believe that the universe is cold and empty; we dream of the day we meet. The coordinates of our home system are attached to this message. \n\nEternally yours, \nPeople of Valin."
 mem_hithere.2a:0 "Maybe we will check up on them."
 mem_hithere.2a.phile:0 "Onwards, towards new friends!"
 mem_hithere.2a.phobe:0 "It would be prudent to see if they are a threat."
 mem_hithere.2a.swarm:0 "More food... yes..."
 mem_hithere.2a.pur:0 "Looks like our hitlist just grew."
 mem_hithere.2a.serv:0 "They need us!"
 mem_hithere.2a.assim:0 "They will make a fine addition to the [Root.GetName]."
 
 mem_hithere_chain_title:0 "Valintu Signal"
 mem_hithere_chain_desc:0 "Somebody sent out a message trying to reach alien intelligence. Perhaps we should pay them a visit."
 
 mem_hithere_poi:0 "Vaitral"
 mem_hithere_poi_desc:0 "The signal's origin."
 
 mem_hithere.3.name:0 "Vaitral System"
 mem_hithere.3.desc:0 "We have arrived at the home system of the Valintu species. However, their homeworld appears to be experiencing the aftermath of large-scale nuclear bombardment. The entire planet is irradiated and devastated, with no signs of life visible. It appears that, between them sending out the message and us receiving it, the Valintu were completely obliterated, either by internal or external conflict."
 mem_hithere.3a.phobe:0 "And nothing of value was lost."
 mem_hithere.3a.swarm:0 "Our food! No!"
 mem_hithere.3a.pur:0 "Somebody stole our kill. Shame."
 mem_hithere.3a.term:0 "It's in the organics' nature to destroy themselves."

 d_mem_hithere_institute:0 "Extrasolar Intelligence Institute"
 d_mem_hithere_institute_desc:0 "Once upon a time, hundreds of the planet's greatest minds were working here, looking for alien intelligence. Now all that is left is ruins... and a vast underground data archive."
 

 
 mem_hithere.4.name:0 "Outer Moon Telescope"
 mem_hithere.4.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has detected a grid of pylons that have been well preserved by the vacuum of space on §Y[From.GetName]§!, the barren sister moon of §YValin§!. From the look of it, the Valintu dedicated considerable effort towards building a highly sophisticated radio telescope designed to search for signals from alien civilizations."
 
 mem_hithere.5.name:0 "Gas Giant Transmitter Array"
 mem_hithere.5.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§!, a gas giant orbited by §YValin§!, still has a massive artificial structure orbiting it. It is badly damaged by space debris, but its purpose is clear - large orbital antennas were used to send radio waves into space. This is likely an origin point for the signal we received."
 
 mem_hithere.6.name:0 "Exploration Rovers"
 mem_hithere.6.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has detected multiple autonomous rovers and debris from the landing modules still present on §Y[From.GetName]§!. It appears the Valintu civilization thoroughly explored the barren planet, despite their primitive means. Some rovers are even still operational, aimlessly wandering and performing pointless tests."

 mem_hithere.7.name:0 "Captured Probe"
 mem_hithere.7.desc:0 "During the survey of §Y[From.GetName]§!, the outermost planet in the Valintu home system, §Y[Root.GetName]§! detected a small probe. It seems that, in addition to the signal the Valintu propagated, they deployed at least one probe with a plaque describing their civilization and how to find it, but this has unfortunately been pulled in by the gravity of the planet."
