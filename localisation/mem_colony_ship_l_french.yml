 mem_colony_ship.2.desc:0 "Early warning systems have detected an unidentified object approaching the §Y[the_system.GetName] System§! at roughly a third of the speed of light. \n\nData collected remains inconclusive, but given the object's speed, it is most likely of artificial origin - an interstellar vessel of primitive design.\n\nIt has not responded to any of our warnings or hails, so its intentions are unknown, but its current path would suggest that  the currently unoccupied planet §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! is its final destination. It is expected to bypass all of our own structures and either crash, land or orbit the planet."
