 mem_broken_clock.1003.desc.lith: "The time goes by and life withers and die. But stone is ethernal. Stone endures and all the rest fades into ashes. \n\nNow look at your own form, born to do nothing but to decay and perish, rotting and crumbling as you watch. Is it not a blasphemy to existence itself to exist in a such a sorry state? \n\nLook at your pitiful self and say farewell to it, for Primacy of Stone has returned to cleanse the Universe of your imperfection."
