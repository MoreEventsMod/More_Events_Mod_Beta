 mem_outsiders_dig_site: "Outsiders"
 mem_outsiders_dig_site_desc: "The barren surface of the [From.Planet.GetName] hides a sprawling but abandoned outpost. \n\nThe outpost's isolation and the lack of any biosphere on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] makes it clear that the former residents did not originate from this planet, but why they chose to settle here is a mystery."

 mem_outsiders.1.name: "A Long Way From Home"
 mem_outsiders.1.desc: "The large building the middle of the outpost seems to also be the oldest. It seemed logical to start at the very beginning of the settlement's history. The research has proven difficult due to the unusual design of the outpost's systems, but eventually [Leader.GetName] was able to decipher a large amount of data. The species that built this outpost called themselves §YNeerteans§! after their distant homeworld. The base itself was referred to as §YNew Neert§!. The building was abandoned at some point and most of the crucial systems transferred to a better equipped facility, but some data and logs remain - perhaps the early days held some sentimental value. Some of the messages cast the colonists in an unusual light however: \n\n§S\"Base Log by Commander Goor. Mission date 1.01.\nThe passage was a complete success. The base capsule suffered minor damage, but that's nothing we can fix. \n\nThe destination matches our models, but to witness it in person is still shocking. It is unsettling to look at the sky and not see any flux residue. The fusion-powered celestial glow is so much brighter than I imagined, almost disturbingly clear in the black sky.\n\nThe lack of access to flux sample means that our research will take additional time, but considering the time differential, this should not be an issue.\"§!\n\nIt seems that the colonists did not just come from another planet, but from another universe entirely, though considering they lived long enough to make the log, their home universe might not be so different after all."
 mem_outsiders.2.name: "Generational Project"
 mem_outsiders.2.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has continued to explore the outpost outwards from the older to new buildings. It appears that many generations of the Neerteans lived, worked and died on [From.Planet.GetName]. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] was able to find and decipher an intact log from an old archive. \n\n§S\"Public Access Newsletter by Commander Trass. Mission date 36.22.\nToday marks the passing of Deputy Chief Engineer Krand, the last surviving member of the original expedition. His dauntless work on the project reminds us all why our forefathers came here and why we are here now. We must never forget this.\"§! \n\nNurseries, schoolhouses, workstations and tombs shed light on endless work of the colonists dedicated to some kind of problem. \n\nIt is unclear at the moment why the colony collapsed. There is some superficial damage consistent with combat that might have disrupted some critical systems, but it's too light to indicate any deliberate attack."
 mem_outsiders.3.name: "Trapped on the Surface"
 mem_outsiders.3.desc: "It seems the Neerteans maintained relations with one or more alien civilizations that were present in this region of the galaxy. [Leader.GetName] has identified a hangar and a supply depot on the outskirts of the colony. Another deciphered log confirms it. \n\n§S\nBase Log by Councillor Veer. Mission date 212.14. \nToday, as agreed, our partners allowed our personnel on one of their vessels. There were no survivors. It is as we feared - outside the gravity wells of a massive celestial body, our bodies require Flux to survive. Our partners expressed the hope that we could eventually overcome this or develop sufficient protection, but I don't think they fully understand the nature of the situation. How can one protect oneself against the absence of something that doesn't even exist in this universe.\"§!\n\nIt seems that Flux - something abundant in the Neertean home universe but absent in our own - was necessary to allow them to travel in space. There's no indication they ever found a way to leave this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] alive, which makes their absence all more ominous."
 mem_outsiders.4.name: "The Flux Problem"
 mem_outsiders.4.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has identified the most advanced laboratory complex in the Neertean colony. It contains most of their research data, but we lack the necessary frame of reference to fully understand the implications. Some of the logs at least provide an insight. \n\n\"§SClassifed Log by Chief Scientist Dalk. Mission date 331.79.\nI think we got it. All the hard work has finally paid off. The model suggests a means to completely halt and partially achieve a reversion of the Flux Decay. I can't wait to contact the Homeworld. I can't wait to find out what the Homeworld really is like.\"§! \n\nIt seems at some point Neerteans have faced an extinction-level problem - Flux Decay. It's not exactly clear what Flux Decay was, because it's not exactly clear what Flux was, but it's something the Neerteans thought would threaten to destroy their entire universe if left unchecked. Facing a critical time shortage, they found a solution - to send some of their best and brightest into our universe, where time flows significantly faster, believing that then the colonists would have enough time to solve the problem and report their findings home."
 mem_outsiders.5.name: "The Difficult Choice"
 mem_outsiders.5.desc: "[Leader.GetName] was able to find the command center that served the Neertean colonists shortly before the collapse. A lot of debates were held in the wake of the completion of their research, and it's not hard to see why from the preserved logs. The colonists might have solved the problem of Flux Decay, but they failed to solve another - how to contact their Homeworld. It seems that while opening the rift from the Neert universe to ours is relatively safe, the reverse is quite destructive. Seeing as Neerteans couldn't leave [From.Planet.GetName], they had to make a choice as to whether they were willing to sacrifice their own lives to save their brethren back home. The last entry into the command center's archive reads: \n\n§S\"Private Log by Commander Zall. Mission date 332.02. \nIt is confirmed. The word is out. We are losing control of the situation.\"§!"
 mem_outsiders.6.name: "The Revolution"
 mem_outsiders.6.desc: "The small lab on the outskirts of the colony seems to be where the signal to Neert was meant to be sent. It was also a site of large amount of fighting between different factions after the central colonial leadership was deposed. The only entry preserved in the lab's archive reads: \n\n§S\"Public Access Newsletter by Provisionary Commander Doon. Mission date 332.24. \nThe lying tyrant Zall has been deposed. He claims it is our §!\"duty\"§S to give up our lives to save the §!\"Homeworld\"§S, but THIS is OUR homeworld. This is where we were born and where we will die. We built it and we built our lives in it. By what right can anyone demand we give it up to save them? We will not allow it. I will not allow it. If any still loyal to Zall think they can defy me, they better change their mind, or I swear to...\"§! \n\nThe log ends abruptly. It's not clear what happened next and whether anyone can be considered victorious in the ensuing civil war. Doon and his followers are nowhere to be found. Neither is Zall. The device designed to rupture the fabric of time space and send the signal to Neert is still intact - neither destroyed nor activated, still waiting for one last command to finish the job."
 mem_outsiders.6.a: "Activate the machine."
 mem_outsiders.6.a.tooltip: "The signal will be sent. [From.Planet.GetName] will be destroyed in process. Who knows if the signal will ever reach the destination? Who knows if it will help anyone there?"
 mem_outsiders.6.b: "Ignore the machine and dismantle the outpost for scraps."
 mem_outsider.7.name: "Extradimensional Signal"
 mem_outsider.7.desc: "We are picking up a signal spreading throughout the galaxy. While most have mistaken it for random noise, we can instantly recognize Neertean codes. \n\nThe message is likely meant for us."
 mem_outsiders.8.desc: "Hello? Can you hear us? \n\nWe understand that our expedition to your universe was destroyed. We are grateful that you were able to finish its work, however. It's impossible to overstate how much your actions have helped our universe. \n\nAs an act of gratitude, we have prepared a technological package with our own research on the interaction between our universes. We are confident that some of it could help you."
 mem_outsiders.8.a: "You are welcome."
 mem_outsiders.8.a.response: "Thank you again. \n\nUnfortunately this will likely be the last time we will ever speak. From now on, all our efforts will be dedicated to mitigating Flux Decay and rebuilding our own civilization. By the time we are done, your civilization will likely be long gone."
 mem_outsiders.8.b: "So everything is fine on your side now?"
 mem_outsiders.8.b.response: "Not fine, no. You can't even imagine the damage Flux Decay has brought onto our universe. Nothing will bring back the countless worlds and billions of lives we lost - and that's in the region we have explored. \n\nBut the situation that seemed hopeless before is not anymore. Our universe might yet endure, even if only the comparatively small region surrounding us."
 mem_outsiders.8.c: "How are you able to communicate with us in real time?"
 mem_outsiders.8.c.response: "We take advantage of the rift first created when we sent the expedition. The closer we are to it, the faster time flows for us."
 mem_outsiders.8.d: "Sorry about your expedition."
 mem_outsiders.8.d.response: "Don't be. We knew well enough that with time flow difference between our two universe there's no chance for those we sent to return. \n\nWe sent them knowing well that it'll have to be their descendants who'll complete their work. It is tragic that the colony fell to infighting, but we had to anticipate that after so many generations, there wouldn't be as much conviction."
 mem_outsiders.8.e: "Will you send another expedition?"
 mem_outsiders.8.e.response: "Unlikely. Beside the titanic effort we had to put into opening a stable rift once, your universe is extremely hostile to us. \n\nThere's nothing to warrant a one-way trip for now."

 tech_mem_outsiders_weaponized_rift: "Weaponized Flux Projection"
 tech_mem_outsiders_weaponized_rift_desc: "By opening rift to the Neertean universe, we can let some flux into our universe, and when focused in a tight beam, those particles can be utterly devastating when interacting with matter from our universe."
