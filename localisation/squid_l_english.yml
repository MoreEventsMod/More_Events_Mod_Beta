 squid.1.name:0 "Eager entrepreneurs at our borders"
 squid.1.desc:0 "A safe passage from [ruthcap.GetAdj] lands to ours had barely been secured, when we received worrying reports from customs on the border. Hundreds of heat signals were detected rapidly approaching our territory, all of them identified as civilian freighters. The local customs officers seem at a loss and fear the incoming tide of merchants could overwhelm their small border control."
 squid.1.xenophile:0 "They are that eager to meet us? Very well, open the border."
 squid.1.xenophobe:0 "Reinforce the border controls and make them turn back!"
 squid.1.individualist:0 "These controls merely hinder trade. Open the border for now."
 squid.1.fanindividualist:0 "I can't hear you over the sound of our own freighters departing."
 squid.2.name:0 "Undercut economy"
 squid.2.desc:0 "It seems that letting in that torrent of [ruthcap.GetAdj] merchants some months ago has harmed our economy. Their wares have been nothing but overpriced trinkets or faulty equipment that is starting to break down, and a multitude of hostile takeovers and squeeze-outs have resulted in monopolies on our planets. We foresee it will take a few years for our economy to recover from this setback."
 squid.3.name:0 "A strange equilibrium"
 squid.3.desc:0 "Now that trade between [ruthcap.GetName] and us is well under way, it seems that we have both been peddling each other useless goods. We ended up neither losing nor making any money out of the transactions, but the [ruthcap.GetName] citizens seem amused."
 squid.1.resigned:0 "Send some officers to help ease their burden."
 squid.2.annoyed:0 "That is less than ideal."
 squid.2.fascinated:0 "And we fell for their ruse? Fascinating."
 squid.4.name:0 "Mind over materialism"
 squid.4.desc:0 "The [ruthcap.GetAdj] merchants we allowed access to our markets some months ago turned out to be peddling nothing but overpriced luxuries and trinkets. Fortunately, it seems our population has little interest in their wares, and the traders have returned home without severely disrupting our economy."
 squid.4.option:0 "Rejoice!"
 squid.5.name:0 "First [peacefultraders.GetAdj] traders arrive"
 squid.5.desc:0 "With a safe passage secured between [peacefultraders.GetName] and the [Root.GetName], the first intrepid merchants have begun exploring their new markets. While the first shipping routes are still being explored, we expect trade to flourish soon."
 squid.5.xenophile:0 "Perfect. Import some [peacefultraders.GetAdj] delicacies for me!"
 squid.5.xenophobe:0 "We must ban all imports from the [peacefultraders.GetName] to protect our heritage."
 squid.5.individualist:0 "Energy credits, says the proverb, make energy credits."
 squid.5.mercenary:0 "Peaceful traders? Perhaps they can use the services of our mercenaries."
 squid.5.peaceful:0 "War is now both unprofitable and unthinkable."
 squid.6.name:0 "Mercenaries return from the [peacefultraders.GetName]"
 squid.6.desc:0 "The [Root.GetAdj] mercenaries who extended their services to [peacefultraders.GetAdj] clients for the past few years have been highly successful. The people of the [Root.GetName] are making a name for themselves abroad as capable warriors and shrewd merchants, and many of them have returned with a nice penny from their adventures while hunting pirates and guarding the affluent."
 squid.6.good:0 "They are true professionals."
 squid.7.name:0 "The [hegimp.GetName] fleet is intimidating our colonies"
 squid.7.desc_01:0 "The [hegimp.GetName] has begun claiming systems near our space. [hegimp.GetAdj] forces have already started fortifying their position and have sent a detachment of their fleet into the border region. Officially, these ships are executing routine maneouvres, but their message is clear: [hegimp.GetName] is here to stay. As a result, the population of [intimplanet.GetName] has started congregating in a Holy Order sworn to defend the planet."
 squid.7.holyorder:0 "Faith put in righteous arms will never waver."
 squid.7.desc_02:0 "The [hegimp.GetName] has begun claiming systems near our space. [hegimp.GetAdj] forces have already started fortifying their position and have sent a detachment of their fleet into the border region. Officially, these ships are executing routine maneouvres, but their message is clear: [hegimp.GetName] is here to stay. As a result, the amount of militia volunteers on [intimplanet.GetName] has surged to unprecedented numbers."
 squid.7.letthemcome:0 "For [intimplanet.GetName]!"
 squid.7.desc_03:0 "The [hegimp.GetName] has begun claiming systems near our space. [hegimp.GetAdj] forces have already started fortifying their position and have sent a detachment of their fleet into the border region. Officially, these ships are executing routine maneouvres, but their message is clear: [hegimp.GetName] is here to stay. As a result, people across our empire are mobilizing to protect our brethren."
 squid.7.unitedfront:0 "Our country won't let [intimplanet.GetName] down."
 squid.7.desc_04:0 "The [hegimp.GetName] has begun claiming systems near our space. [hegimp.GetAdj] forces have already started fortifying their position and have sent a detachment of their fleet into the border region. Officially, these ships are executing routine maneouvres, but their message is clear: [hegimp.GetName] is here to stay. As a result, the population of [intimplanet.GetName] has united to pray for courage in these trying times."
 squid.7.prayer:0 "We won't give in to despair."
 squid.7.desc_05:0 "The [hegimp.GetName] has begun claiming systems near our space. [hegimp.GetAdj] forces have already started fortifying their position and have sent a detachment of their fleet into the border region. Officially, these ships are executing routine maneouvres, but their message is clear: [hegimp.GetName] is here to stay. However, the people of [intimplanet.GetName] have responded to these provocations by turning their attention inwards."
 squid.7.default:0 "They are wise not to give in to fear."
 squid.8.name:0 "A stellar performance"
 squid.8.desc:0 "A popular musician from the [rockstar_origin.GetName] has been topping their charts lately, and has even garnered a mild success abroad. Looking to break through on a galactic scale, he has set his sights on a possible tour on [tour_location.GetName]. A part of the local population is stoked for what they consider to be a once in a lifetime event, although there are some who claim his music has questionable influence on our youth."
 squid.8.xenophile:0 "What an opportunity to witness his culture first hand!"
 squid.8.xenophobe:0 "Deny him entry, and ban his music for good measure."
 squid.8.individualist:0 "Everyone has the right to an opportunity at stardom."
 squid.8.lodsofemone:0 "I know; I'm the one selling tickets."
 squid.8.collectivist: "We shouldn't idolise vain individuals."
 squid.8.religiousdogma:0 "The way he rumbles his [rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesOrganName] is highly indecent. Ban this filth."

 squid.8.woodstock:0 "Three months of Peace & Music."
 squid.8.default:0 "Let the planetary administration decide."
 squid.9.name:0 "The first concert on tour"
 squid.9.rock:0 "\"Good morning [tour_location.GetName]! Are you ready to rock? I say, are you ready to rock?\"\n\nThe [rockstar_origin.GetAdj] band, styling themselves \"Blasters N' Orchids\", energetically set in the first song of the evening. The universal translating system on stage had trouble following the lead singer, nearly overheating during certain parts of his performance. When he turned it off, the audience seemed to know the [rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] lyrics by heart."
 squid.9.dubstep:0 "Crowds of fans stood in the arena for the [rockstar_origin.GetAdj] artist's debut in [tour_location.GetName]. The audience exploded in rapturous cheers when he walked on stage, nodding their heads to a heavily synthesized musical score that occasionally built up before arbitrarily dropping the bass. One can't help but wonder why he had to come all the way to [tour_location.GetName] to press a button on stage."
 squid.9.incomprehensible:0 "The [rockstar_origin.GetAdj] artist must have brought some sort of instruments on stage. It would be impossible to explain the crowd's reaction otherwise. And yet, when he played them, there was only silence.\n\nA cursory investigation revealed that [rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] music is traditionally played at frequencies that [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can't hear."
 squid.9.festival:0 "The [rockstar_origin.GetAdj] band played in an open field under a radiant sun. On the festival grounds, various groups of unwashed and sleep-deprived fans milled about, ingesting unhealthy amounts of alcoholic beverages and abusing questionable substances. This scene repeated itself on various locations on [tour_location.GetName], always leaving a trail of refuse and trash in its wake. But everyone agreed they had a lot of fun."
 squid.9.rapper:0 "The [rockstar_origin.GetName] musician, styling himself \"50 creds\", was less singing than firing off a rapid barrage of [rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] slangs and slurs. During the final act of the night, he glorified the lifestyle of his working class family, a neighbourhood that was often heart-breaking and sometimes violent, after which he thanked the audience, asked them to \"keep it real\" and left for the next tour location on his luxurious private shuttle."
 squid.9.metal:0 "The musicians, self-styled as \"Power[rockstar_origin.GetSpeciesNameCompliment]\", were clad in black leather, studded with the occasional metal chains or spikes. The vocalist let out a primal growl that caused the universal translator on set to spout nonsense, though the equipment was soon drowned out by music that seemed to hit around 200 decibels. The typical \"dance\" to this performance seemed to consist of violent head convulsions."
 squid.9.dontunderstand:0 "I don't understand the appeal, really."
