 mem_wargame.1.name:0 "Champ de bataille antique"
 mem_wargame.1.desc:0 "The trinary §Y[From.GetName] System§! is quite an unusual sight. \n\nLittered with debris, it nevertheless is also filled with life, and multiple planets in the system seem to host primitive civilisations. \n\nWe are detecting an abandoned station orbiting one of the isolated planets, quietly watching over the system."
 mem_wargame.1.a:0 "Nous devrions enquêter."

 MEM_WARGAME_EXPLORE_STATION:0 "Exploring Abandoned Station"
 MEM_WARGAME_EXPLORE_STATION_DESC:0 "When surveying the §Y[mem_wargame_system.GetName] System§!. we encountered an abandoned station orbiting one of the planets. It might hold interesting information regarding the system's past."

 mem_wargame.2.name:0 "War Games"
 mem_wargame.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports the successful investigation of a strange station orbiting [mem_wargate_station_planet.GetName]. \n\nJudging by surviving data cores, the system was set up as a massive experiment, or possibly a form of entertainment. \n\nFour species were uplifted by an unknown party, provided with FTL-incapable warships and set to fight each other, while their benefactors could watch from a safely hidden location on the system's outskirts. \n\nThe experiment came to abrupt end when a group of conspirators from all four species infiltrated the station and massacred everyone on board. Strangely, no retaliation followed, and the natives, lacking the practical knowledge required to maintain the technology they had been gifted, soon settled back into primitive life."

 mem_wargames_station_site: "Station abandonnée"
 mem_wargames_station_site_desc: "Nichée à la périphérie du système, cachée par l'atmosphère d'une géante gazeuse, cette station abandonnée mérite définitivement une étude."

 mem_wargame.3.name: "The Hangar"
 mem_wargame.3.desc: "It wasn't that hard to find an entry point to the station. A shuttle hangar is left wide open, and the air has been vented, leaving no atmosphere in this section of the station. \n\nScorch marks from energy weapons are seen on some of the walls, along with, surprisingly enough, impacts from chemically propelled ballistic weaponry. The reason for the air venting remains unclear for now - but it was definitely not due to fighting."
 mem_wargame.4.name: "The Viewing Hall"
 mem_wargame.4.desc: "Archaeologists are making progress inside the station orbiting [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nTheir most recent discovery is a large room, with walls covered with large screens and filled with amenities for large numbers of viewers. A bar, tables and seating are identifiable. Minor signs of fighting, such as shattered glasses and broken screens, can also be seen."
 mem_wargame.5.name: "War Games"
 mem_wargame.5.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports the successful investigation of a strange station orbiting [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nJudging by surviving data cores, the system was set up as a massive experiment, or possibly a form of entertainment. \n\nFour species were uplifted by an unknown party, provided with FTL-incapable warships and set to fight each other, while their benefactors could watch from a safely hidden location on the system's outskirts. \n\nThe experiment came to abrupt end when a group of conspirators from all four species infiltrated the station and massacred everyone on board.

 mem_wargame.5.pacphobe: "Play stupid games - win stupid prizes."
 mem_wargame.5.mil: "Sounds fun."
 mem_wargame.5.mat: "It was probably very educational."
