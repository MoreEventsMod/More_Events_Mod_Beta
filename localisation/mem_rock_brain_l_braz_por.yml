 mem_rock_brain.201.title:0 "Request for Assistance"
 mem_rock_brain.201.desc:0 "Our research post at [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] monitoring the rock brain has sent an urgent message: the brain appears to have become aware of outside forces monitoring it! They request support from a science ship urgently!"
 mem_rock_brain.201.a:0 "Send a ship at once!"
 mem_rock_brain.201.b:0 "Thinking or not, it's just rock. We have more important priorities."

 MEM_ROCK_BRAIN_PROJECT:0 "Talking to the Rock"
 MEM_ROCK_BRAIN_PROJECT_DESC:0 "This asteroid is shot through with strange veins of ore carrying electrical charges that seem to function as a sort of brain - a brain which has become aware of our monitoring. Our research station at the rock is requesting assistance opening communications."
 
 mem_rock_brain.203.title:0 "Science and the Rock"
 mem_rock_brain.203.desc:0 "Our researchers have successfully opened communication with the rock. It appears to have a form of sapience, though one unlike anything we have previously seen prior, a form of intelligence we have difficulty even describing in words, much less understanding. It was apparently unaware that a universe existed outside of itself, and had existed in isolated solipsism for millions, if not billions, of years before our arrival. It has had difficulty in understanding concepts such as 'existence', 'non-existence', 'space', 'motion'; in attempting to explain, one of our scientists downloaded a copy of a basic physics textbook into it. It began to ask questions based on the material, and further questions based upon the answers, until it quickly reached the frontiers of modern physics - and passed them. The brain is evidently eager to contribute to our scientific research efforts, and has a deeply unique perspective on the nature of reality. This is likely to be a fruitful partnership."
 mem_rock_brain.203.a:0 "Wonderful."

The brain is evidently eager to continue talking philosophy with our thinkers, and has a deeply unique perspective on the nature of reality. This is likely to be a fruitful partnership."

 mem_rock_brain.205.title:0 "Poetry and the Rock"
 mem_rock_brain.205.desc:0 "Our researchers have successfully opened communication with the rock. It appears to have a form of sapience, though one unlike anything we have previously seen prior, a form of intelligence we have difficulty even describing in words, much less understanding. It was apparently unaware that a universe existed outside of itself, and had existed in isolated solipsism for millions, if not billions, of years before our arrival. It spent much of that time composing something that is not entirely unlike poetry - which it is evidently eager to share now that it has an audience. Its poetry is... Fascinating. Marvelous. Utterly, utterly unique. The rock's work has become an object of public obsession, and there is considerable cheer at our meeting with this unique intelligence."
 mem_rock_brain.205.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 mem_rock_brain.211.title:0 "The Rock's Latest Volume"
 mem_rock_brain.211.desc:0 "The rock brain at [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] has published a new volume of poetry, prompting widespread public applause."
 mem_rock_brain.211.a:0 "Wonderful."
 mem_rock_brain.211.b:0 "That's nice, but stop telling me every time."
 
 mem_poetry_released:0 "Poetry Published"
 mem_poetry_released_desc:0 "Your people are pleased by the release of a new volume of alien poetry."
