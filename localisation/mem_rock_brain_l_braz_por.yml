 mem_rock_brain.201.title:0 "Request for Assistance"
 mem_rock_brain.201.desc:0 "Our research post at [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] monitoring the rock brain has sent an urgent message: the brain appears to have become aware of outside forces monitoring it! They request support from a science ship urgently!"
 mem_rock_brain.201.a:0 "Send a ship at once!"
 mem_rock_brain.201.b:0 "Thinking or not, it's just rock. We have more important priorities."

 MEM_ROCK_BRAIN_PROJECT:0 "Talking to the Rock"
 MEM_ROCK_BRAIN_PROJECT_DESC:0 "This asteroid is shot through with strange veins of ore carrying electrical charges that seem to function as a sort of brain - a brain which has become aware of our monitoring. Our research station at the rock is requesting assistance opening communications."
 
 mem_rock_brain.203.title:0 "Science and the Rock"
 mem_rock_brain.203.desc:0 "Our researchers have successfully opened communication with the rock.\n\nIt appears to have a form of sapience, though one unlike anything we have seen before, a form of intelligence we have difficulty even describing in words, much less understanding. It was apparently unaware that a universe existed outside of itself, and had existed in isolated solipsism for millions, if not billions, of years before our arrival. It has had difficulty in understanding concepts such as 'existence', 'non-existence', 'space' and 'motion'.\n\nIn attempting to explain, one of our scientists downloaded a copy of a basic physics textbook into it. It began to ask questions based on the material, and further questions based upon the answers, until it quickly reached the frontiers of modern physics - and passed them.\n\nThe brain is evidently eager to contribute to our scientific research efforts and has a deeply unique perspective on the nature of reality. This is likely to be a fruitful partnership."
 mem_rock_brain.203.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 mem_rock_brain.204.title:0 "Philosophy and the Rock"

This is likely to be a fruitful partnership."
 mem_rock_brain.204.a:0 "Wonderful."

 mem_rock_brain.205.desc:0 "Our researchers have successfully opened communication with the rock.

It was apparently unaware that a universe existed outside of itself, and had existed in isolated solipsism for millions, if not billions, of years before our arrival. It spent much of that time composing something that is not entirely unlike poetry - which it is evidently eager to share now that it has an audience.\n\nIts poetry is... Fascinating. Marvellous. Utterly, utterly unique.\n\nThe rock's work has become an object of public obsession, and there is considerable cheer at our meeting with this unique intelligence."
 mem_rock_brain.205.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 mem_rock_brain.211.title:0 "The Rock's Latest Volume"
 mem_rock_brain.211.desc:0 "The rock brain in [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] has published a new volume of poetry, prompting widespread public applause."
 mem_rock_brain.211.a:0 "Wonderful."
 mem_rock_brain.211.b:0 "That's nice, but stop telling me every time."
 
 mem_poetry_released:0 "Poetry Published"
 mem_poetry_released_desc:0 "Your people are pleased by the release of a new volume of alien poetry."

 mem_rock_brain.301.desc:0 "Ever since we first became aware of the so-called §Y"rock brain"§!, a seemingly thinking structure inside asteroid §Y[From.GetName]§!, it has captivated the minds of our scientists.\n\n[rock_brain_leader.GetName] is claiming that [rock_brain_leader.GetSheHe] know[rock_brain_leader.GetSXX] a way to uncover its secrets, but this would require [rock_brain_leader.GetHerHim] to brave the asteroid's surface alone with minimal protections."
 mem_rock_brain.301.a:0 "Allow this."
 mem_rock_brain.301.a.tooltip:0 "[rock_brain_leader.GetName] will leave to prepare for the expedition. Let's hope [rock_brain_leader.GetSheHe] know[rock_brain_leader.GetSXX] what [rock_brain_leader.GetSheHe] [rock_brain_leader.GetIsAre] doing..."
 mem_rock_brain.301.b:0 "No. This is too risky."

 mem_rock_brain.302.name:0 "Rock Brain: Scientist-Eater"
 mem_rock_brain.302.desc:0 "As arranged, [rock_brain_leader.GetName] arrived on [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] today via a specially charted shuttle.\n\nAs [rock_brain_leader.GetSheHe] stepped outside onto the surface, remote monitoring showed activity within the rock brain growing until suddenly it surged to previously unheard of levels. At this instant, [rock_brain_leader.GetName]'s signal vanished from our sensors.\n\nSoon after, the rock brain's activity began to decrease, but plateaued at a level higher than previously recorded. No sign of [rock_brain_leader.GetName] was found on the surface, as if the rock brain had consumed [rock_brain_leader.GetHimHer]."
 mem_rock_brain.302.a:0 "You'd better choke on [rock_brain_leader.GetHerHim], rock."

At this instant, [rock_brain_leader.GetName]'s signal vanished from our sensors, right after [rock_brain_leader.GetSheHe] sounded a distress call over critical environmental breaches in [rock_brain_leader.GetHisHer] vacuum suit.\n\nMoments later, the activity fell to normal levels. [rock_brain_leader.GetName]'s charred remains were soon recovered from the asteroid's surface."

 mem_rock_brain.311.desc:0 "You hear me? Good.\n\nHello. It is I, [rock_brain_leader.GetName].\n\nYou probably thought I was dead, but you better believe me, I am very much alive. I have never been more alive. The rock brain did consume me, that's true, but it didn't §Sdestroy§! me. I have merely transformed.\n\nI have become one with the rock brain. My mind has joined its mind in a state of infinite harmony.\n\nThe only thing I would request from you is not interfere with our work. Observe us if you must, and eavesdrop on our thoughts if you wish, but do not intervene. "
 mem_rock_brain.311.a:0 "Very well."
 mem_rock_brain.311.a.tooltip:0 "[rock_brain_leader.GetName] will live inside the Rock Brain's mind. [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] will now be known as [rock_brain_leader.GetName]. \n\nScience output of [mem_rock_brain_planet.GetName] increased significantly."
 mem_rock_brain.311.b:0 "Are you alright?"
 mem_rock_brain.311.b.reponse:0 "I have never been better. Do not worry, in my current state, there's no such thing as pain or fear, or any other unpleasantness you have to deal with. I have left this behind for good."
 mem_rock_brain.311.c:0 "Is there a way to rescue you?"
 mem_rock_brain.311.c.reponse:0 "Rescue me? From what? For what?\n\nWhat do you have to offer? To give me back my [rock_brain_leader.Species.GetAdj] body? Turn me back into a pitiful pile of cells shuffling around aimlessly, without purpose until it succumbs to old age?\n\nNo. I now know more than you can even imagine. I §Sam§! more than you can conceive. I think about things you can't even conceptualize. I don't need your help, or your pity."
 mem_rock_brain.311.d:0 "Can you share any insights with us?"
 mem_rock_brain.311.d.reponse:0 "With you? No.\n\nYou can't even conceive of the things I know now. There's no words to name them, or theories through which to rationalize them.\n\nPerhaps one day you will be able to understand a tiny fraction of my wisdom. This day won't come any time soon."
