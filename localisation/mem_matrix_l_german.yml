 # Initial Anomaly Text
 mem_matrix_category:0 "Ancient Structure"
 mem_matrix_category_desc:0 "Orbital scans of §Y[From.GetName]§! have detected an intact structure among the ancient ruins of this devastated world. Further investigation is needed."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Success
 mem_matrix.1.name:0 "Shocking Revelation"
 mem_matrix.1.desc:0 "This complex of ancient buildings is being maintained by some sort of rudimentary AI. This computer system appeared to take no notice of our team entering the building. Deeper inside the complex, a shocking revelation awaited our scientists: thousands of humanoid aliens confined in pod-like structures and connected to the central computer! They show very high levels of brain activity. The system seems to keep these inhabitants alive while confined in the pods, even breeding replacements to compensate for losses. Chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes it will take some time to study the databases and find out what the purpose of this place is."
 mem_matrix.1.a:0 "Unsettling."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Failure
 mem_matrix.2.name:0 "Just a Malfunction"
 mem_matrix.2.desc:0 "There must have been a scanner malfunction. Our survey team found nothing but ruins and debris at the indicated location."
 mem_matrix.2.a:0 "Well, let's move on."
 
 # Matrix Anomaly Critical Failure
 mem_matrix.3.name:0 "Ancient Defence Grid"
 mem_matrix.3.desc:0 "When §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the rest of the survey team entered the ancient structure, they unknowingly activated an automatic defence system. Their distress call was drowned by heavy gun fire and the collapse of the building. None of them made it out alive..."
 mem_matrix.3.a:0 "Horrible!"
 
 # Matrix Complex Investigation Project
 MEM_MATRIX_INVESTIGATION:0 "Ancient Complex"
 MEM_MATRIX_INVESTIGATION_DESC:0 "Our scientists want to study the cybernetic complex found on §Y[From.GetName]§."
 
 # Get the building and some research
 mem_matrix.5.name:0 "Neural Network"
 mem_matrix.5.desc:0 "Detailed analysis of the stored data revealed the history of this complex. It was once some sort of prison as well as a science institute specialised in neural connections and AI research. Their greatest triumph backfired horribly when their first self-aware AI used the planetary arsenal of nuclear weaponry to perform its own research. The resulting conflagration purged the entire planet of life - except for the contents of this facility. From then on, the AI has slowly rewritten itself, becoming more and more passive. It has created multiple layers of realities for its prisoners to experience to keep them pacified, letting them believe themselves to be living a normal life and making sure they remain unaware of the truth of their situation. The AI itself has become obsessed with the idea that reality is an illusion - that it is not a computer but a simulation of one, just a part of a program in another plane of existence. The AI's program has become so fiercely entangled in this recursion that it will be impossible to access it without destroying the entire system, but since it currently uses only a fraction of its available resources, we could use the rest of the supercomputer at will."
 mem_matrix.5.a:0 "Very interesting."
 
 # Matrix Complex Description
 d_mem_matrix:0 "Neural Computer Complex"
 d_mem_matrix_desc:0 "An ancient research complex - housing thousands of connected beings - working as a giant computer."
