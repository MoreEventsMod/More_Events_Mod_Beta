 mem_doom_dig_site: "At Doom's Gate"
 mem_doom_dig_site_desc: "This barren planet once contained an advanced research outpost. However, it now lies in ruins, the site still littered with the mummified remains of its previous inhabitants. Their killers are nowhere to be found. \n\nThe destruction of the outpost must have occurred hundreds of years ago, yet scans indicate that some facilities might still be intact underground. Against all odds, we are picking up a power source buried deep within. What could have survived and still be operational after all this time?"
 
 mem_doom.1.name: "The Entryway"
 mem_doom.1.desc: "The archaeological expedition has made a breakthrough. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] has finally located a relatively intact passage leading from the surface into the underground sections. \n\nJust like the surface, the hallways are littered with the dead bodies of the previous occupants. Their death was violent, but the cause of it is not entirely clear due to the extensive damage sustained - both by the bodies and their surroundings. It also appears that some bodies belonged to a military force of some sort, perhaps a damage control or cover up team sent in to contain the situation. \n\nJudging by the overall state of affairs, they were not particularly successful."
 mem_doom.1.a: "$DIG$"
 mem_doom.2.name: "The Command Core"
 mem_doom.2.desc: "The archaeological expedition has made a major breakthrough. A recently discovered room turned out to house the command core controlling computer systems around the facilities.\n\nA major firefight clearly took place here, and out of the mass of neglected and destroyed computers, only a couple are still functional. They primarily contain logs regarding a massive energy flow from something called §SSite Zero§! to the distribution network on the planet's surface, but there's also a backup transcript titled §SCritical Incident 05484§! containing the following: \n§gShift Supervisor:§! Oh, this can't be good. \n§Y<<Unintelligible>>\n<<Loud Unidentified Noise>>§!\n§RAlert:§! Sensor 2 readings outside acceptable parameters.\n§RAlert:§! No readings from sensors 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9. \n§SError:§! Control Module 4 does not exist anymore.\n§g<<End transcript>>§!"
 mem_doom.3.name: "The Stone Storage"
 mem_doom.3.desc: "The archaeological team reports new findings: Some distance away from the main working areas, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! found a collection of stone tablets. \n\nThe stone itself appears to be procured from the depths of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! and the script on the tablets seems to have been written during the time when the facility was still operational, yet the language on most of them is completely different from what we found in the rest of the site and is undecipherable to us. What little there is written in the language of the site's operators is rambling and borderline incomprehensible, alluding to something called §YTalnekhreck§!. \n\nStrangely, there's no sign of fighting in the room, yet many stones are covered with excessive amounts of dried blood. Some of it is estamated to date back to decades before the fall of the facility."
 mem_doom.4.name: "Unfathomable Depths"
 mem_doom.4.desc: "As they descend deeper into the heart of the alien facility, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! and [Leader.GetHerHis] team encounter more and more things that don't make sense. \n\nSeveral rooms appear to be filled with an energy field of some sort. Invisible to most sensors, it makes any object that enters the room vanish into thin air. Additionally, spherical pockets of radiation just float about in space, defying all laws of nuclear physics. \n\nThe remains of the facility personnel are found more and more sparsely. On the other hand, the walls are no longer a familiar blend of alloys and polymers, but now closely resemble fossilized flesh. \n\nSome further information can be gleaned from the surviving computer terminals. The facility was built above a naturally occurring dimensional rift in §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!'s crust. Its purpose was to research the unusual nature of the pocket universe on the other side and channel energy from it for their empire's needs. However, the realm they connected to was not as empty as they thought, and something unfriendly followed through with the energy flow."
 mem_doom.5.name: "Site Zero"
 mem_doom.5.desc: "The archaeological team has made its way to the deepest levels of the facility. They are now standing at the bottom of it - right above a massive cavern called §SSite Zero§!. \n\nThe regular technology of the facility, built out of metal and plastics, has given way to strange jagged rocks, resembling teeth or claws of gargantuan beasts. The pillars of strange, organic texture try to reach the hatch in the roof leading to the rest of facility but are cut off just a few meters short. A massive pile of charred corpses covers the cavern floor. \n\n[Leader.GetName] concluded that a squad of elite soldiers once entered this place and descended into the caverns, then re-emerged and moved onwards towards a different segment of the facility."
 mem_doom.5.a: "Follow that trail."
 mem_doom.6.name: "The Malign Capacitor"
 mem_doom.6.desc: "The final destination of the elite squad whose scent we picked up at the §SSite Zero§! was not that far away. As far as we can infer, the resistance they encountered was not that great, yet as they were low on ammunition and manpower, the squad dwindled. \n\nTheir goal was apparently an auxiliary facility specifically established in case of events such as those that transpired - however, when the worst occurred and it was needed, the facility was overrun. The final battle apparently cost the lives of the remaining soldiers, though they managed to secure the facility. \n\nThe logs found on their power armour give some further clarity to the situation. A being they called §YTalnekhreck§! sent one of its offspring into the facility, where it subtly influenced the personnel, demanding sacrifices to nourish itself and its parents. Over time, §YTalnekhreck§! itself has breached through, killing some of the facility personnel and mutating others. At great cost, the portal was collapsed. \n\nThe squad in charge made an attempt to destroy everything that contained otherworldly influence. They failed. \n\nA single unit still powering itself with otherworldly energy is sitting there, just beyond the last dead body's reach."
 mem_doom.6.a: "We'll take it. It'll be safe if handed carefully."
 mem_doom.6.b: "Let's finish the job and destroy it."
 
 mem_doom.7.name: "The Spectral Wyrm Manifests"
 mem_doom.7.desc: "As the Malign Capacitor reaches full power, its energy gains a form. A powerful otherworldly being, given shape by the Talnekhreck itself, has manifested above §Y[Capital_Scope.GetName]§! and is ready to do our bidding."
 mem_doom.7.a: "Hail Talnekhreck!"

 mem_doom.100.name: "Ruined Outpost"
 mem_doom.100.desc: "Despite the widespread devastation of [From.GetName], [Leader.GetName] was still able to locate a technological ruin on the surface of the planet. \n\nAn archaeological site has been established to further investigate it."
