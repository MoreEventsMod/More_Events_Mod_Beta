 mem_disguised_planet_category_desc:0 "Atmospheric patterns of this planet do not entirely match simulations, and several deep scans have provided data wildly inconsistent with other tests."
 
 mem_disguised_planet.1.name:0 "Holographic disguise"
 mem_disguised_planet.1.desc:0 "Further investigation has revealed that the supposedly toxic atmosphere of [From.GetName] does not actually exist. Clever usage of holographic generators, light refraction and particle dispersion created the convincing illusion that the planet had a thick, hostile atmosphere. \n\nOnce the fake clouds were parted, [Root.GetName] discovered... a completely barren world, concealed beneath the illusion. It seems someone went to great lengths to disguise this inhospitable rock as a different kind of inhospitable rock."
 mem_disguised_planet.1.a:0 "What was even the point?"
 
 mem_disguised_planet.2.name:0 "A Hidden World"
 mem_disguised_planet.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that the supposedly toxic atmosphere of [From.GetName] is not actually toxic at all. \n\nClever usage of holographic generators, light refraction and particle dispersion created the convincing illusion that the planet had a thick, hostile atmosphere, while in reality the atmosphere appears to be quite benign. Once the fake clouds had been parted, a habitable surface was revealed beneath. \n\nIt seems that, at some point, someone put considerable effort into disguising this world as something far less hospitable."

 mem_disguised_planet.3.name:0 "A Mystery Wrapped in an Enigma"
 mem_disguised_planet.3.desc:0 "Further investigation has revealed that the supposedly toxic atmosphere of [From.GetName] does not actually exist. Clever usage of holographic generators, light refraction and particle dispersion created the convincing illusion that the planet has a thick hostile atmosphere. \n\nWhat [Root.GetName] actually discovered beneath the fake clouds was quite odd - a tiny planet covered entirely in a shield that appears to be entirely impenetrable, meaning that it remains completely unclear by whom and for what purpose this planet was so extensively hidden."
 mem_disguised_planet.3.a:0 "Very odd."
 
 mem_disguised_planet.100.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_disguised_planet.100.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] could not replicate previous anomalous readings on [FromFrom.GetName]. They were likely caused by improperly calibrated sensors."
 mem_disguised_planet.100.a:0 "Disappointing."
 
 mem_disguised_planet_modifier:0 "Holographic projectors"
 mem_disguised_planet_modifier_desc:0 "Ancient holographic projectors produce false images of toxic clouds over this world."
 
 d_mem_disguised_planet_mystery_pile:0 "Mystery Pile"
 d_mem_disguised_planet_mystery_pile_desc:0 "It's unclear what exactly this pile is, except that it is composed of highly complex polymers, is painful to look at, and smells foul. It also wobbles."

 d_mem_disguised_planet_triple_deposit:1 "Hidden Valley"
 d_mem_disguised_planet_triple_deposit_desc:1 "Safely concealed beneath false images of a toxic world lies a valley rich in rare resources."
