 mem_agrarian_dig_site: "Agrarian Idyll"
 mem_agrarian_dig_site_desc: "A small isolated region on this planet is covered in neat rows of farm plots - overgrown with plants, but still recognizable. This feature looks very out of place, especially considering that this is the only pre-existing artificial structures on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nMechanized farming equipment is still rusting in the fields, while farm owners are nowhere to be found."

 mem_agrarian.1.name: "Mass Grave"
 mem_agrarian.1.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports discovering the likely explanation of the previous inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nOn the outskirts of the settlement, [Leader.GetSheHe] discovered a trench where multiple bodies in bags were bumped before concrete was poured over them. The trench appears to be segmented with filling of uneven quality, suggesting that the process of dumping the bodies took months if not years. The bodies discovered inside is estimated to account for about 60-80% of the households, depending on how communal the species was. \n\nNo obvious signs of trauma are found on the bodies, neither any traces of radioactive contamination, known poisons or corrosives. However, due to lack of living specimen for reference and the sorry state of the mass grave in general it is impossible to infer a cause of death."
 mem_agrarian.2.name: "The Hospital"
 mem_agrarian.2.desc: "We have discovered a half-buried building in the outskirts of the settlement. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! believes that it was served as a hospital while the colony was still alive. \n\nThe building itself was mostly cleared out and a lot of documents destroyed. It appears that despite opting for low-tech solutions where they could, such as plant-based writing surfaces, clay brickwork and wooden furniture, the settlers did have access to advanced technologies that they used whenever necessary, such as sophisticated medical scanners and molecular pharmaceutical printers. \n\nThe hospital records have faded away, though §Y[Leader.GetName]§! infers a highly contagious disease has affected the settlers at some point."
 mem_agrarian.3.name: "The Antenna"
 mem_agrarian.3.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports uncovering something odd right in the middle of the abandoned settlement on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nAt a relatively shallow depth the archaeologists have found an extremely tall antenna. Its foundation seems to be deliberately placed right in the middle of the settlement, likely to ensure stable coverage. The antenna is not designed for any faster-than-light specifications, but nevertheless it is arguably the most advanced piece of technology recovered yet. \n\nThe exact nature of the signal transmitted is uncertain at the moment, but it is likely that the source of the signal could be found underground, right under the antenna."
 mem_agrarian.4.name: "Biomass Control"
 mem_agrarian.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports successfully breaching the underground complex beneath the antenna on [From.Planet.GetName]. Compared to the rest of the settlement, it is extremely advanced, placing it on the level of an average space faring civilisation. Most of the equipment is broken, but some data was still recovered. The events leading to extinction of the planet's population became clear. \n\nThe settlers originated from an civilisation that was active in distant part of the galaxy as a group of primitivist seeking to escape what they perceived as oppressive technological society stifling their spirituality. \n\nWith only limited technology they deemed necessary they made their way on [From.Planet.GetName] and established a colony. In order to bolster their ranks and ensure workforce sufficient for the colony's operation they brought specially designed programmable biomass - which was at the time inferior to robotic technology but better suited for their primitivist way of life. \n\nThe underground complex and antenna were, in fact, a control system for the biomass constructs. "
 mem_agrarian.5.name: "The Masterpiece"
 mem_agrarian.5.desc: "After an extensive research, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! have pieced together the rest of the events that caused to the colony on [From.Planet.GetName] to collapse. \n\nFor a while, colony operated smoothly and settlers enjoyed a simple life until they encountered an infection, likely native to the world. Most of them succumbed quickly, but for a small fraction it would take years to die. Despite the quarantine measures, the infection spread could not be stopped and all settlers contracted it. The only unaffected form of life was the biomass. Realizing they are doomed, settlers opted to copy their minds into the biomass control system and live their lives as constructs. \n\nOne technician involved however had a different plan. Seeing himself as some kind of ultimate artist, he sabotaged the transfer system to give himself full access to personality cores. After the process was complete, he has erased all other settler's memories of their true nature and dedicated all his time to tinkering with their personalities. Unaware of anything that is happening or who they really are, the practically immortal settlers relived the same day again and again as biomass constructs among slowly decaying buildings and neglected fields, while the only self-aware person kept altering their personalities and memories to create something more to his liking. \n\nThis process lasted for about 40 years until a power outage interrupted the transmission and caused all constructs to disintegrate. It seems the only person who knew that the complex even existed had no interest in maintaining it."
 mem_agrarian.5.a: "A fascinating tale."

 d_mem_agrarian_deposit_desc: "A sizeable area once settled by a group of alien colonists. The fertile lands lie abandoned after their owners died out from an epidemic."
