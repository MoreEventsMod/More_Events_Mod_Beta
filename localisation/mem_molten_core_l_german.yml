 mem_molten_core_category_desc:0 "Like most molten worlds, §Y[Root.GetName]§! is covered by streams and seas of lava. However, something is clearly unusual about this particular planet, visible even from orbit. Like the average continental world, around 70% of the planet's surface is covered with liquid, despite all predictions stating the lava should have solidified long ago as this [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s sun does not provide enough heat to keep its surface in this state."
 mem_molten_core.1.name:0 "Exposed Core"
 mem_molten_core.1.desc:0 "While it is common for molten planets to have many exit points for magma from the liquid outer core to reach the surface, §Y[From.GetName]§! seems to have taken this to the next level. Almost 40% of the planet's surface is exposed outer core, which has resulted in the vast seas that provoked the study. Probes can easily be launched to explore the centre of the planet, shedding new light on planetary geology that would require costly mining efforts on any other world. This makes §Y[From.GetName]§! perfect for research efforts."
 mem_molten_core.1.a:0 "Good to hear."
 mem_molten_core.99.name:0 "Solidifying Seas"
 mem_molten_core.99.desc:0 "A report from §Y[This.GetLeaderName]§! on the lava seas of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! shows that their presence is nothing more than a fluke. Already the surface is beginning to cool, and it is expected that within a few years the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s lava-to-land ratio will be typical for a molten world."
 mem_molten_core.99.a:0 "Very well."
