 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure_category_desc:0 "During the survey, our scientist team has detected a structure on the surface of the asteroid."

 # Failure
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.1.name:0 "Dangerous Conditions"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.1.desc:0 "Whatever the structure once was, it has been lost to the ravages of time. Our probes have been unable to find a safe path to the structure, making salvage an impractical effort. [Root.GetLeaderName] has called off the expedition."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.1.a:0 "Too bad."

 # Salvage
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.2.name:0 "Empty"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.2.desc:0 "It appears whomever built the structure abandoned it long ago, leaving nothing behind to tell us of its intended purpose. While disappointing, at least the materials that make up the structure can be salvaged for use elsewhere."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.2.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 # Power source
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.3.name:0 "Strange Power Source"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.3.desc:0 "Examination of the base has yielded an unusual power source. It appears to be reliant on a miniature singularity held stable by unknown technology, and our researchers are understandably wary of attempting to interfere with such a source for study. However, it appears that the rest of the technology is well within our understanding, and the structure can be adapted to suit our needs."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.3.a:0 "Make it happen."

 # Interesting composition
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.4.name:0 "A Space Oddity"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.4.desc:0 "Our researchers are still unsure of the original intent of the facility. However, the design of the structure itself is fascinating, and has been described by our researchers as 'nauseating', 'frightening', and 'completely, utterly impossible.' Whoever inhabited the facility completely ignored traditional thoughts of design, and it has led to some theories regarding how they may have achieved such a stupifying structure. \n\nPlacing a research facility in orbit could help to further understanding of the technology involved."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.4.a:0 "Interesting."

 # Small warp loop
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.5.name:0 "Pendulum" 
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.5.desc:0 "It appears the base was designed for research. \n\nNear the asteroid is what appears to be a stable formation of disturbed subspace, which it appears several large asteroids were caught. The loop causes them oscillate near the asteroid, each returning to their original position within an hour's time.\n\nWhile it does appear that the event is in decay, it is predicted that the effect of the loop will last at least 2.6 billion years, allowing us ample time to study its effects in full. Placing a reseach base of our own would help to facilitate further understanding of the phenomena."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.5.a:0 "Fascinating."

 # Strange warp technology
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.6.name:0 "Mistakes"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.6.desc:0 "Whoever designed this base did so with the purpose of researching an unknown propulsive technology for faster than light travel. Given the size of the crater near the remains of the base, it appears as if they were wholly unsuccessful in their attempts. There are several prototypes within the facility which could be tested more carefully by our own researchers to determine exactly how, as well as if, they work. The rebuilding of the base would help to proceed with these experiments."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.6.a:0 "Make it so."

 # Interesting biology
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.7.name:0 "Lost Laboratory"
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.7.desc:0 "We have found several interesting leads from the base, despite much of it being destroyed. \n\nIn a part of the structure open to space, we have found a large repository of biological samples, some of which have intense regenerative properties. From the fragmented archives we were able to descipher, it appears the research base was intended to help combat a virulent plague affecting their species at least several hundred years ago. Given the end state of the laboratory, it seems that initiative most probably failed. \n\nWhile the virus should not affect our biology in any way, [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested placing a facility in orbit to access the samples and the original research, and has quarantined all personnel who accessed the laboratory for a time."
 mem_asteroid_derelict_structure.7.a:0 "Prudent."
