 d_mem_crystals_mining:0 "Crystal Fields"
 d_mem_crystals_mining_desc:0 "An area covered with semi-living mineral formations spawned by an ancient void crystal. Periodically harvesting these crystals will significantly increase the mineral output capacity of this colony but at the price of a weakened ecosystem and reduced agricultural output."
 
 d_mem_crystals_science:0 "Crystal Fields"
 d_mem_crystals_science_desc:0 "An evergrowing area covered with semi-living mineral formations spawned by an ancient void crystal. Studying these crystals will benefit the colony's research efforts, while reducing its mineral and agricultural output capacities."
 
 mem_crystal_removal:0 "Crystal Removal"
 mem_crystal_removal_desc:0 "A significant part of this colony's efforts go into the removal of the crystal infestation, which has now spread over the planet."

 # Crystal appears in player system
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.name:0 "Crystalline Entity Approaches"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.desc:0 "Our colony's long-range sensors have picked up an alarming signal approaching from out of deep space. A hastily-dispatched probe revealed it to be a giant crystalline structure. A communication attempt from our vessel was followed by an intense energy spike and immediate loss of contact with the probe.\n\nWe have to assume the crystal is hostile. Our fleet has been put on high alert."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.a:0 "Why is it here?"
 
 # crystal has bombarded the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.name:0 "Death from Above"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.desc:0 "The colonial defence force stood no chance against the crystal entity. Immediately after the battle had been decided, it started to shower [This.GetName] with small crystal shards fired at high velocity. First reports speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties.\n\nWhile these numbers still rise by the hour, the crystal has left the planet's orbit and flown back into the void."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
 # crystal has been destroyed before bombarding the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.name:0 "Danger Averted"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.desc:0 "Our fleet has been victorious. Only broken shards are left of the crystal entity. Why it came here and attacked might never be revealed, but our colony is safe once again.\n\nA brief scan of the crystal's remains showed them to be composed of highly valuable minerals. Nearby freighters have already been ordered to gather them. While most of these shards will be scraped for resources, the more interesting pieces will be kept for further study.\n\nSome of our scientists already fantasize about possible applications like self-repairing hulls, while others point out that there is much foundational research to be done before we can even hope for a big breakthrough."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.a:0 "Good work."
 
 # crystal has been destroyed after bombarding the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.4.name:0 "Retribution"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.4.desc:0 "Our fleet has been victorious. Only broken shards are left of the crystal entity. Though we might never know where it came from and why, at least its destruction has avenged the victims of its brutal attack.\n\nA brief scan of the crystal's remains showed them to be composed of highly valuable minerals. Nearby freighters have already been ordered to gather them. While most of these shards will be scraped for resources, the more interesting pieces will be kept for further study.\n\nSome of our scientists already fantasize about possible applications like self-repairing hulls, while others point out that there is much foundational research to be done before we can even hope for a big breakthrough."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.4.a:0 "Good work."
 
 # Project finished
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.name:0 "Crystal Analysis"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.desc:0 "The recovered crystal shards show remarkable similarities to the smaller specimens we have encountered before, yet there is a striking difference in their behaviour. While previously-encountered crystals acted aggressively, their actions had always been limited to their own territory. Also, the enormous size of this larger specimen leads our scientists to the conclusion that it has to be a new species.\n\nThe material which makes up almost the entirety of its mass possesses astonishing self-repairing abilities, a property that may be applied to our ship's armor plates given more time and research. A new research option has been added to the project pool."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 # crystals grow everywhere, what now?
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.name:0 "Crystal Infestation"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.desc:0 "As the colonists on [Root.GetName] were still recovering from the devastating attack, we received worrying reports about crystalline fragments growing in various locations around the settlements.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the spreading of these crystals is not limited to the vicinity of the colony. Instead, they can be found in varying concentrations across the planet, slowly extracting minerals from the soil throughout their growing process. It is hard to tell at this point how this will affect the planet's ecosystem.\n\nThere are multiple possible courses of action to be taken. The colonists can try to root out the crystal infestation, periodically harvest them, or study their growth."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.a:0 "Let them harvest the crystals regularly."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.a.tooltip:0 "§GMineral output +50%§!\n§G+2 mining district slots§!\n§G+2 rare crystal collector jobs§!\n§R-2 agricultural district slots§!"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.b:0 "Let them study the crystals."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.b.tooltip:0 "§GSociety research +20%\n§GEngineering research +20%\n+2 research jobs\n+1 additional research job for every 20 pops\n§G+1 rare crystal collector job§!\n§R-2 farming districts\n-1 mining district\nMining output -10%§!"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.c:0 "Let them root out the crystal infestation."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.c.tooltip:0 "The colonists on [Root.GetName] will focus on removing every last crystal spawn. All minerals gained during this process will be added to the empire storage at the end of this process. The productivity of this colony will be reduced by 50% until this process is completed. It is to be expected that the planet's ecosystem will be able to fully recover once the work is done."
 
 # planet turns bleak
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.name:0 "Biosphere Changes"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.desc:0 "Despite the colonists' constant efforts to contain the crystal infestation, the spreading has now reached a critical extent. The damage to the planet's ecosystem is now undeniable. Farming outputs are at record lows and vegetation in general is in a state of steady decline as the crystals exhaust the soil.\n\nThough our scientists are confident that they can prevent the planet from becoming completely lifeless, they doubt that this process can be reversed without extensive terraforming."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.a:0 "Concerning."
 
 # crystals removed
 mem_space_monster_attacks.8.name:0 "The Great Cleansing"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.8.desc:0 "Finally, the last remaining traces of the crystal infestation on [Root.GetName] have been removed. Colonial life is slowly returning to normal.\n\nThe processed crystals have been added to our imperial storage."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.8.a:0 "Good news."
 
 MEM_SPACE_MONSTER_ATTACKS_CRYSTAL_STUDY:0 "Crystalline Remains"
 MEM_SPACE_MONSTER_ATTACKS_CRYSTAL_STUDY_DESC:0 "An investigation of the remaining crystal shards could prove beneficial to our research efforts, but our research department will have to devote significant resources and personnel to focus on this study."
