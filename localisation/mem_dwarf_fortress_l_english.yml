 #Anomaly
 mem_dwarf_fortress_category:0 "Inside the Fire"
 mem_dwarf_fortress_category_desc:0 "Deep scans indicate an unusual shape on the surface, implying a possible artificial structure."

 #simple fail 
 mem_dwarf_fortress.1.name:0 "Just Hot Air"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.1.desc:0 "It appears the strange shape was just a plateau where heat and the uneven density of magma distorted the scans. Nothing artificial has been found at the site."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.1.a:0 "Time to move on then."
 
 #spawn the site later
 mem_dwarf_fortress.2.name:0 "Discovery inside the Fire"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.2.desc:0 "Our miners have located an entrance to a cave system of apparently artifical origin beneath the scorching surface of [mem_dwarf_fortress_planet.GetName].\n\nStarting an excavation would mean the complete halt of any mining operations, but who knows what secrets the deeps may hold."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.2.a:0 "Start an excavation."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.2.b:0 "We cannot stop our mining operation for this."
 
 #anomaly success, found digsite
 mem_dwarf_fortress.3.name:0 "Strike the Earth"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.3.desc:0 "After various exploration drillings our science team located multiple underground passages belonging to an elaborated cave system of apparently artificial origin.\n\nIt is impossible to estimate how far it reaches."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.3.a:0 "Investigate it further."

 #Dwarf fortress digsite
 mem_dwarf_fortress_site:0 "Into the Depths"
 mem_dwarf_fortress_site_desc:0 "An apparently artificial cave system has been located beneath the scorching surface of [mem_dwarf_fortress_planet.GetName]. Though temperatures are dangerously high, sufficient heat resistant equipment should allow for further exploration."
 
 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 1 Pressure plate
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.name:0 "Hot Feet"
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist dead
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_01:0 "After following the largest of the writhing tunnels for quite some time the expedition finally found definitive proof of this place having been constructed rather than being a random natural occurance.\n\nBefore the scientists the tunnel apruptly deepens into a quarry-like pit. A stone plate with unidentified writing on it marks the beginning of roughly hewn stone stairs leading down on one and up again on the opposite side leaving an empty floor dozens of meters long inbetween them.\n\nWhile crossing the pit [Leader.GetName] stepped upon a hidden pressure plate thus unwittingly activating a trap mechanism. Lava quickly flooded the pit only stopping shortly before reaching the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, none of the team made it out in time.\n\nThe lava has already started to cool down and is expected to be safely traversable in a few days."
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist injured
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_02:0 "While crossing the pit one of [Leader.GetName]'s assistants stepped upon a hidden pressure plate thus unwittingly activating a trap mechanism. Lava quickly flooded the pit only stopping shortly before reaching the top of the stairs. Unfortunately the exploration team did not make it out of the pit unharmed. [Leader.GetName] will never be the same."
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist alive and well
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_03:0 "While crossing the pit one of [Leader.GetName] spotted a hidden pressure plate. After a quick investigation it was revealed to be part of an elaborate trap mechanism that would - if activated - have flooded the entire pit with lava. The team will now be on the lookout for more such traps."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.a:0 "This is terrible! But we have to move on."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.b:0 "This is unfortunate, but keep pushing forward."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.c:0 "Good work. Continue."

 #"Another science team has successfully entered the complex. Despite their best efforts to not pull any dangerous levers that might unleash "unpleasantries", [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetName] apparently unwittingly stepped on a hidden pressure plate, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling, filling the room [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] and [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were in."

 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.desc:0 "The research team successfully entered the fortress. However, whilst exploring its vestibule, [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetName] appears to have stepped on a hidden pressure plate, causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling filling the entire complex. Both the fortress and our science team are lost."

 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.name:0 "A Colossal Cave-in"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.desc:0 "The research team successfully got into the fortress. However, while exploring the interiors, [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetName] unwittingly pulled a lever seated in one of the rooms, causing the sole support column to suddenly snap, resulting in a cave-in and the total destruction of the entire complex."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #Success in first try
 mem_dwarf_fortress.10.name:0 "Lava Fortress"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.10.desc:0 "Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin. From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects, a substantial portion of their history could be reconstructed. The facility was established in harsh conditions under the belief that, deep underneath, they could find a vein or two of a rare--and to them incredibly valuable--ore. By pumping magma to the surface, they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defence system relying on multiple lava floodable areas, as well as finding a means of disposing their "undesirables"--as shown extensively and repeatedly in the reliefs.\n\nAt first, the outpost grew steadily, and its prosperity attracted many newcomers. Many inhabitants not only worked in the mines but also turned to fine arts, creating objects intricately decorated with fractal images of themselves and other beautiful yet weird creations.\n\nDespite being constantly besieged by nebulous rivals, the colony endured for multiple generations, but as the dig to the planetary core drew near conclusion, a catastrophic event from inside the community must have happened. As best we can determine from the state of these ancient remains, and also the fact that there are only remains of this one alien species, our science team came to the conclusion that there must have been a devastating civil war. Also, the alien's storage containers were filled with a plethora of goods and equipment, disproving the hypothesis that the crisis was caused by a resource shortage. To the amusement of the others, one of our scientists pointed out there wasn't any kind of protective foot gear despite the fact that most of the reliefs found emphasized it as an important sign of social standing. Unfortunately, our team was unable to uncover any further details."

 mem_dwarf_fortress.10.b:0 "Such a unique and amazing species..."
