 mem_dwarf_fortress.2.desc:0 "Our miners have located an entrance to a cave system of apparently artifical origin beneath the scorching surface of [mem_dwarf_fortress_planet.GetName].\n\nStarting an excavation would mean the complete halt of any mining operations, but who knows what secrets the deeps may hold."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.2.a:0 "Start an excavation."

 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 1 Pressure plate
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.name:0 "Hot Feet"
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist dead
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_01:0 "After following the largest of the writhing tunnels for quite some time the expedition finally found definitive proof of this place having been constructed rather than being a random natural occurance.\n\nBefore the scientists the tunnel apruptly deepens into a quarry-like pit. A stone plate with unidentified writing on it marks the beginning of roughly hewn stone stairs leading down on one and up again on the opposite side leaving an empty floor dozens of meters long inbetween them.\n\n-----While crossing the pit [Leader.GetName] stepped upon a hidden pressure plate thus unwittingly activating a trap mechanism. Lava quickly flooded the pit only stopping shortly before reaching the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, none of the team made it out in time.\n\nThe lava has already started to cool down and is expected to be safely traversable in a few days."
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist injured
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_02:0 "-----While crossing the pit one of [Leader.GetName]'s assistants stepped upon a hidden pressure plate thus unwittingly activating a trap mechanism. Lava quickly flooded the pit only stopping shortly before reaching the top of the stairs. Unfortunately the exploration team did not make it out of the pit unharmed. [Leader.GetName] will never be the same."
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist alive and well
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_03:0 "-----While crossing the pit one of [Leader.GetName] spotted a hidden pressure plate. After a quick investigation it was revealed to be part of an elaborate trap mechanism that would - if activated - have flooded the entire pit with lava. The team will now be on the lookout for more such traps."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.a:0 "This is terrible! But we have to move on."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.b:0 "This is unfortunate, but keep pushing forward."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.c:0 "Good work. Continue."
 
 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 2 Cave in collumn

 #Cave in collumn - Smash - Scientist dead
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.desc_01:0 "From the pit going onward the quality of the tunnel steadily improved - now smoothed stone surfaces what was rough rock walls before - leading our expedition into a bigger cavern and apparently the entrance of some kind of bunker-like structure. In the middle of the cavern a single large column holds the weight of the entire ceiling. On it another stone plate with writing we cannot decipher resides above...a lever?!\n\n-----[Leader.GetName] and [Leader.GetHisHer] colleagues couldn't help but try to lift the mystery of what this mechanism was going to do. Leaving all precaution behind [Leader.GetSheHe] moved the lever.\n\nA clicking noise followed by a loud crumbling filled the hall. Then all of a sudden the collumn and the ceiling above came crashing down to the ground before slowly rising back to their former position afterwards, revealing those unfortunate enough to have been caught by their weight."

 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.desc_03:0 "-----Though being pushed by [Leader.GetHisHer] own curiosity as well as [Leader.GetHisHer] colleagues [Leader.GetName] chose to resist this infantile urge and study the mechanism using [Leader.GetHisHer] scanner from a save distance. The results then confirmed [Leader.GetHisHer] suspicion.\n\nThe lever connects to an elaborated mechanism which holds the column and large parts of the ceiling in place, ready to let them fall to groundlevel and afterwards lift them back up to their initial position. Who would create such a trap?"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.a:0 "Send another team. We won't give up!"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.b:0 "Reprimand the survivors to be more cautious."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.c:0 "Watch out for more of these."
 
 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 3 - Danger room
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.name:0 "Danger Room"
 #Danger room - Stab - Scientist dead or injured
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.desc_01:0 "In contrast to all expactations getting into the bunker was suprisingly easy as the main gateway was only partly closed. The expedition was greeted by a grim scene however. Mummified corpses of short yet stout humanoid aliens littered the ground. It isn't clear what exactly happened, but all of them appear to have met a violent end.\n\nThe first accessable complex near the bunker's entrance apparently served as barracks and armory for security personel. These aliens seemed to have had technology comparable to our own, utilizing powerarmors and energy based weaponry. Still large portions of the storage area were occupied by obsolete meelee weapons like hammers and axes.\n\nLooking further into the complex, [Leader.GetName] wandered into what [Leader.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall. When a team member blithely pulled an unmarked lever, multiple spikes rapidly emerged from the floor, then retracted as quickly as they had appeared. Iconography that appeared when the lever was pulled suggests these spikes were intended to train users in dodging techniques.\n\n-----By the look of it, [Leader.GetName] and most of [Leader.GetHisHer] team were mediocre dodgers at best..."
 #Danger room - Stab - Scientist alive and well
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.desc_02:0 "-----Gracefully evading any incoming danger [Leader.GetName] managed to deactivate the 'training' mechanism before anybody got seriously infured. The lever-pulling fool has been relieved of his position in the aftermath of this situation."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.b:0 "Not great, not terrible."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.c:0 "Were do we find those people?"

 #"Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin.

 #"Another science team has successfully entered the complex. Despite their best efforts to not pull any dangerous levers that might unleash "unpleasantries", [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetName] apparently unwittingly stepped on a hidden pressure plate, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling, filling the room [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] and [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were in."
 
 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 4 - Commercial district
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.name:0 "Dark Humor"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.desc:0 "Leaving the entrance section behind [Leader.GetName] and [Leader.GetHisHer] team have entered what they consider to be a commercial district. From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects, a substantial portion of the former inhabitant's history could be reconstructed. This facility was established in these harsh conditions under the belief that, deep underneath, a vein or two of a rare--and to them incredibly valuable--ore could be found. By pumping magma to the surface, they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defence system relying on multiple lava floodable areas, as well as finding a means of disposing their "undesirables"--as shown extensively and repeatedly in the reliefs.\n\nA finding of particular value however was a library that provided our linguists with enough samples to translate the aliens' language. Not only will this make interactions with their technology easier, it also gave us a glimpse of their humor. The archived images of the stone plates found at the trap locations do read as follows: "Watch your steps..." and "Don't touch this!" for the lava and lever trap respectively. Another example was a tombstone in on of their burial grounds showing a warrior being impaled by multiple spikes at once in its relief with the caption "Why didn't you dodge?!" Unneccessary to say this brought back some not so distant memories...\n\n[Leader.GetName] expects to find more information on what happened here by searching the central section which is currently on lockdown behind a massive gate."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.a:0 "Pry it open."

As best we can determine from the state of these ancient remains, and also the fact that there are only remains of this one alien species, our science team came to the conclusion that there must have been a devastating civil war. Also, the alien's storage containers were filled with a plethora of goods and equipment, disproving the hypothesis that the crisis was caused by a resource shortage. To the amusement of the others, one of our scientists pointed out there wasn't any kind of protective foot gear despite the fact that most of the reliefs found emphasized it as an important sign of social standing. Unfortunately, our team was unable to uncover any further details."
