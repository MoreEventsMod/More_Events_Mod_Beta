 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 1 Pressure plate
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.name:0 "Hot Feet"
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist dead
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_01:0 "After following the largest of the winding tunnels for quite some time, the expedition finally found definitive proof of this place having been constructed rather than being a random natural occurrence.\n\nBefore the scientists, the tunnel abruptly deepens into a quarry-like pit. A stone plate with unidentified writing on it marks the beginning of roughly hewn stone stairs, leading down on one side and up again on the other, leaving an empty floor dozens of meters long in between them.\n\n-----While crossing the pit, [Leader.GetName] stepped upon a hidden pressure plate, thus unwittingly activating a trap mechanism. Lava quickly flooded the pit, only stopping shortly before reaching the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, none of the team made it out in time.\n\nThe lava has already started to cool down and is expected to be safely traversable in a few days."
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist injured
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_02:0 "-----While crossing the pit, one of [Leader.GetName]'s assistants stepped upon a hidden pressure plate, thus unwittingly activating a trap mechanism. Lava quickly flooded the pit, only stopping shortly before reaching the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, the exploration team did not make it out of the pit unharmed. [Leader.GetName] will never be the same."
 #Pressure plate - Fire hot - Scientist alive and well
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.desc_03:0 "-----While crossing the pit, [Leader.GetName] spotted a hidden pressure plate. After a quick investigation, it was revealed to be part of an elaborate trap mechanism that would - if activated - have flooded the entire pit with lava. The team will now be on the lookout for more such traps."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.a:0 "This is terrible! But we have to move on."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.4.b:0 "This is unfortunate, but keep pushing forward."

 #Cave in collumn - Smash - Scientist dead
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.desc_01:0 "From the pit going onward, the quality of the tunnel steadily improved – smoothed stone surfaces replacing rough rock walls - leading our expedition into a bigger cavern and apparently the entrance of some kind of bunker-like structure. In the middle of the cavern, a single large column holds the weight of the entire ceiling. On it, another stone plate with writing we cannot decipher resides above...a lever?!\n\n-----[Leader.GetName] and [Leader.GetHisHer] colleagues couldn't help but try to uncover the mystery of what this mechanism was built to do. Leaving all precaution behind, [Leader.GetSheHe] moved the lever.\n\nA clicking noise followed by a loud crumbling filled the hall. Then, all of a sudden, the column and the ceiling above came crashing down to the ground, before slowly rising back to their former position to reveal those unfortunate enough to have been caught by their weight."

 #Cave in collumn - Smash - Scientist alive and well
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.desc_03:0 "-----Though being pushed by [Leader.GetHisHer] own curiosity as well as [Leader.GetHisHer] colleagues, [Leader.GetName] chose to resist [Leader.GetHisHer] infantile urge to pull the lever, instead deciding to study the mechanism using [Leader.GetHisHer] scanner from a safe distance. The results then confirmed [Leader.GetHisHer] suspicions.\n\nThe lever connects to an elaborated mechanism which holds the column and large parts of the ceiling in place, ready to let them fall to the ground and afterwards lift them back up to their initial position. Who would create such a trap?"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.a:0 "Send another team. We won't give up!"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.5.b:0 "Reprimand the survivors to be more cautious."

 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 3 - Danger room
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.name:0 "Danger Room"
 #Danger room - Stab - Scientist dead or injured
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.desc_01:0 "In contrast to all expectations, getting into the bunker was surprisingly easy, as the main gateway was only partly closed. The expedition was greeted by a grim scene, however. Mummified corpses of short yet stout humanoid aliens littered the ground. It isn't clear what exactly happened, but all of them appear to have met a violent end.\n\nThe first accessible complex near the bunker's entrance apparently served as a barracks and armory for security personnel. These aliens seemed to have had technology comparable to our own, utilizing power armors and energy-based weaponry. However, curiously, large portions of the storage area were occupied by obsolete melee weapons like hammers and axes.\n\nLooking further into the complex, [Leader.GetName] wandered into what [Leader.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall. When a team member blithely pulled an unmarked lever, multiple spikes rapidly emerged from the floor, then retracted as quickly as they had appeared. Iconography that appeared when the lever was pulled suggests these spikes were intended to train users in dodging techniques.\n\n-----By the look of it, [Leader.GetName] and most of [Leader.GetHisHer] team were mediocre dodgers at best..."
 #Danger room - Stab - Scientist alive and well
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.desc_02:0 "-----Gracefully evading any incoming danger, [Leader.GetName] managed to deactivate the 'training' mechanism before anybody got seriously injured. The lever-pulling fool has been relieved of his position in the aftermath of this incident."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.b:0 "Not great, not terrible."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.6.c:0 "Were do we find those people?"

 #"Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin.

 #"Another science team has successfully entered the complex. Despite their best efforts to not pull any dangerous levers that might unleash "unpleasantries", [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetName] apparently unwittingly stepped on a hidden pressure plate, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling, filling the room [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] and [mem_dwarf_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were in."
 
 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 4 - Commercial district
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.name:0 "Dark Humor"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.desc:0 "Leaving the entrance section behind, [Leader.GetName] and [Leader.GetHisHer] team have entered what they believe to be a commercial district. From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects, a substantial portion of the former inhabitants' history could be reconstructed. This facility was established in these harsh conditions under the belief that, deep underneath, a vein or two of a rare--and to them incredibly valuable--ore could be found. By pumping magma to the surface, they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defence system relying on multiple lava-floodable areas, as well as finding a means of disposing their "undesirables"--as shown extensively and repeatedly in the reliefs.\n\nA finding of particular value however was a library that provided our linguists with enough samples to translate the aliens' language. Not only will this make interactions with their technology easier, it also gave us a glimpse of their humor. The archived images of the stone plates found at the trap locations read as follows: "Watch your steps..." and "Don't touch this!" for the lava and lever trap respectively. Another example was a tombstone in one of their burial grounds showing a warrior being impaled by multiple spikes at once in its relief, with the caption "Why didn't you dodge?!" Unnecessary to say that this brought back some not so distant memories...\n\n[Leader.GetName] expects to find more information on what happened here by searching the central section, which is currently locked behind a massive gate [Leader.GetSheHe] has yet to open."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.a:0 "Pry it open."

 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 5 - Central district
 mem_dwarf_fortress.8.name:0 "Of Fire and Blood"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.8.desc:0 "Opening the gate was quite the endeavor. Once the excavation team finally reached the inside it became clear that this wasn't on accident. Someone had put in a lot of effort to seal it from the inside, apparently even to the point of being unable to open it from this side again. Not that anyone would have tried. As it appears the inhabitants had been more concerned killing eachother, though the reason for it became only clear after one of the scientists stumbled over a chronicle in the bunker's data storage.\n\nAt first, the outpost had grown steadily, and its prosperity attracted many newcomers. Many inhabitants not only worked in the mines but also turned to fine arts, creating objects intricately decorated with fractal images of themselves and other beautiful yet weird creations.\n\nDespite being constantly besieged by nebulous rivals, the colony endured for multiple generations, but as the dig to the planetary core drew near conclusion, a catastrophic event from inside the community had happened. The 'Lord of the Guard' had challenged the bunker's overseer to a duel over the possession of a highly valuable artifact only mentioned by its name 'Oltarudib'. The duel had quickly turned to a fight of life and death ending with the challenger's victory. Following entries report about consecutive duels such as the first one on a daily basis. The end of the chronic is a single line repeated over and over again: "It will be mine!"\n\nThe situation seemed to have escalated quickly and the excavation team wonders what kind of object could bring an entire society to collapse. Unfortunately no further information about the artifact was to be found.\n\nIn an effort to find out more about the valuable material this mining colony was created for the scientists then proceeded to head for the core-boring section only to be met by another barricaded doorway..."
 mem_dwarf_fortress.8.a:0 "You know the drill."
 
 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 6 - Core-boring section
 mem_dwarf_fortress.9.name:0 "Mass Psychosis"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.9.desc:0 "When the doorway had been cleared noone in the excavation team was suprised to find more corpses in this section. However one of them stood out.\n\nHidden in the most secluded corner a lone corpse leans on the wall still holding a strange-looking oversized metal boot. Next to the dead a datapad was found shedding some light on the nature of the strange item. Though the only thing written in the last log entry was "Mine, it is finally mine!!!!" [Leader.GetName] quickly concluded that the metal sabaton had to be 'Oltarudib', the reason for the breakdown of this colony.\n\nOn closer inspection it turned out that parts of the artifact were made of the very rare material that outpost had been established to mine. In the facility's chronicles it was named 'living metal' for its ability to return to a 'remembered' form if damaged of manipulated. What the former inhabitants of this place apparently failed to realize were the adverse longterm effects of prolonged contact with this material on their mental health. [Leader.GetName] advised to avoid direct physical contact with this substance as well as protective clothing when interacting with it.\n\nThe deposit of this rare metal seems to be far from exploited and given sufficiant security measures the mining operation can be resumed."
