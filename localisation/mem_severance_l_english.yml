 mem_severance_dig_site: "Lost Planet"
 mem_severance_dig_site_desc: "Isolated from the rest of the galaxy, [From.Planet.GetName] clearly once was a home to an advanced civilisation. \n\nThe ruins are still scattered across the surface, but no advanced forms of life can be detected from orbit. Where did they all go?"

 mem_severance.1.name: "The Volnar Colony"
 mem_severance.1.desc: "Our archaelogical expedition on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has produced the first tangible results. \n\nThe species that previously lived on this planet called themselves §SVolnars§! and is estimated to have disappeared from the face of the planet about 500 years ago. It was also conclusively confirmed that Volnars did not evolve on [From.Planet.GetName] and arrived as colonists from a different world; but what is especially strange is that they did not appear to posesses any Hyperdrive technology to do so. \n\nWhenever they utilized some kind of sleeper ship or generation ship technology or were transported by some other more advanced alien culture remains unclear."
 mem_severance.2.name: "The Severance"
 mem_severance.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports a major finding on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] has recovered logs of a large-scale scientific and political conference that took place shortly before the collapse of the Volnar colony. It's been called to discuss the event called \"§SSeverance§!\" \n\nThe Volnar has never acheived Hyperdrive technology, instead they discovered a wormhole in their home system. The wormhole connected them to [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] where they discovered a pristine world ripe for colonization. Over the years, various nation-states and corporations from that planet has claimed parts of the planet as their colonies. \n\nThis all came to an abrupt end when wormhole suddenly collapsed, the event they called Severance.The colonists were facing great uncertainty. The planet was mostly self-sufficient, but it relied heavily on off-world management and international treaties signed on the homeworld, running the planet mostly as business venture and not as a nation. \n\nWithout that, and left to their own devices, different factions started wying for dominance."
 mem_severance.3.name: "Layers Upon Layers"
 mem_severance.3.desc: "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have encountered something very surprising - nn another archaeological dig. \n\nThis dig site was operated by Volnar colonists and they seem to be researching artefacts left behind by someone else. It appears Volnars were not the first one to come to this world, but information regarding their predecessors is scarce. \n\nIt is strongly suggested that they weren't the originally from [From.Planet.GetName] either, but there isn't enough material for a proper study."
 mem_severance.4.name: "The Red Zone"
 mem_severance.4.desc: "Archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have finally completed survey of the massive industrial zone stretching across noticable part of the planet. Designated as a \"Red Zone\" by the Vorlan colonists, it was a sprawling urban area controlled by several major corporations. \n\nDuring the first years of colonization, many of the Volnar poorer citizens have signed up for off-world employment hoping to improve their lot in life. As the time went on, the industrial zones expanded as corporations moved outwards to new resource deposits, leaving behind massive abandoned areas full of unemployed workers and industrial pollution. \n\nThis situation turned much worse after the Severance, as shortage of personnel and economic downturn took hold leaving significant areas impovershed and lawless, ultimately leading to uprising and rise of criminal syndicates and warlords in the slums. It appears that several corporate compounds were invaded and looted by a horde of disenfranchised workers, requiring intervention from factions from different parts of the planets to finally bring peace to the region."
 mem_severance.5.name: "The Constitution Hall"
 mem_severance.5.desc: "Our continued research on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! the seat of the first united planetary government. \n\nAfter a prolonged period of strife on the planet, several major factions were able to broker a deal and formalize the peace agreement. It appears that most powers on the planets have found the terms satisfactory, ranging from remainders of corporate power structure to former government agencies administer national colonies to Red Zone warlords. The newly formed united planetary government chose to retrofit a massive corporate arcology at the outskirts of Red Zone renaming it Constution Hall to house most of governmental agencies. \n\nFor a few years it appears the situation was stable, and Volnars, tired of endless conflict worked together to rebuild their civilization away from the homeworld. After that, all the record stopped."
 mem_severance.6.name: "The End"
 mem_severance.6.desc: "The final chapter in the events that transpired on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! was uncovered. \n\nIt appears just as the Volnars have resolved their differences, the planet was invaded by some kind of machines. \n\nWith their spaceflight technology severely lacking, the colonists had no way to resist the invaders and apparently were wiped out or rounded up and abducted within less of an a year. They cities were left to decay for 500 years until we re-discovered them. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! proposes that the entire [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is an elaborate trap to lure colonists in through a wormhole, sever the connection and invade them soon after."
