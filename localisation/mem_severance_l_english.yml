 mem_severance_dig_site: "Lost Planet"
 mem_severance_dig_site_desc: "Isolated from the rest of the galaxy, [From.Planet.GetName] clearly once was a home to an advanced civilisation. \n\nThe ruins are still scattered across the surface, but no advanced forms of life can be detected from orbit. Where did they all go?"
 
 mem_severance.1.name: "The Volnar Colony"
 mem_severance.1.desc: "Our archaeological expedition on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has produced the first tangible results. \n\nThe species that previously lived on this planet called themselves §SVolnars§! and is estimated to have disappeared from the face of the planet about 500 years ago. It was also conclusively confirmed that Volnars did not evolve on [From.Planet.GetName] and arrived as colonists from a different world; but what is especially strange is that they did not appear to possess any Hyperdrive technology to do so. \n\nWhenever they utilized some kind of sleeper ship or generation ship technology or were transported by some other more advanced alien culture remains unclear."
 mem_severance.2.name: "The Severance"
 mem_severance.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports a major finding on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] has recovered logs of a large-scale scientific and political conference that took place shortly before the collapse of the Volnar colony. It's been called to discuss the event called \"§SSeverance§!\" \n\nThe Volnar has never achieved Hyperdrive technology, instead they discovered a wormhole in their home system. The wormhole connected them to [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] where they discovered a pristine world ripe for colonization. Over the years, various nation-states and corporations from that planet has claimed parts of the planet as their colonies. \n\nThis all came to an abrupt end when wormhole suddenly collapsed, the event they called Severance.The colonists were facing great uncertainty. The planet was mostly self-sufficient, but it relied heavily on off-world management and international treaties signed on the homeworld, running the planet mostly as business venture and not as a nation. \n\nWithout that, and left to their own devices, different factions started wying for dominance."
 mem_severance.3.name: "Layers Upon Layers"
 mem_severance.3.desc: "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have encountered something very surprising - nn another archaeological dig. \n\nThis dig site was operated by Volnar colonists and they seem to be researching artefacts left behind by someone else. It appears Volnars were not the first one to come to this world, but information regarding their predecessors is scarce. \n\nIt is strongly suggested that they weren't the originally from [From.Planet.GetName] either, but there isn't enough material for a proper study."
 mem_severance.4.name: "The Red Zone"
 mem_severance.4.desc: "Archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have finally completed survey of the massive industrial zone stretching across noticeable part of the planet. Designated as a \"Red Zone\" by the Vorlan colonists, it was a sprawling urban area controlled by several major corporations. \n\nDuring the first years of colonization, many of the Volnar poorer citizens have signed up for off-world employment hoping to improve their lot in life. As the time went on, the industrial zones expanded as corporations moved outwards to new resource deposits, leaving behind massive abandoned areas full of unemployed workers and industrial pollution. \n\nThis situation turned much worse after the Severance, as shortage of personnel and economic downturn took hold leaving significant areas impoverished and lawless, ultimately leading to uprising and rise of criminal syndicates and warlords in the slums. It appears that several corporate compounds were invaded and looted by a horde of disenfranchised workers, requiring intervention from factions from different parts of the planets to finally bring peace to the region."
 mem_severance.5.name: "The Constitution Hall"
 mem_severance.5.desc: "Our continued research on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! the seat of the first united planetary government. \n\nAfter a prolonged period of strife on the planet, several major factions were able to broker a deal and formalize the peace agreement. It appears that most powers on the planets have found the terms satisfactory, ranging from remainders of corporate power structure to former government agencies administer national colonies to Red Zone warlords. The newly formed united planetary government chose to retrofit a massive corporate arcology at the outskirts of Red Zone renaming it Constitution Hall to house most of governmental agencies. \n\nFor a few years it appears the situation was stable, and Volnars, tired of endless conflict worked together to rebuild their civilization away from the homeworld. After that, all the record stopped."
 mem_severance.6.name: "The End"
 mem_severance.6.desc: "The final chapter in the events that transpired on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! was uncovered. \n\nIt appears just as the Volnars have resolved their differences, the planet was invaded by some kind of machines. \n\nWith their spaceflight technology severely lacking, the colonists had no way to resist the invaders and apparently were wiped out or rounded up and abducted within less of an a year. They cities were left to decay for 500 years until we re-discovered them. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! proposes that the entire [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is an elaborate trap to lure colonists in through a wormhole, sever the connection and invade them soon after."
 mem_severance.6.a: "Are they going to come after us next?"
 mem_severance.6.a.tooltip: "The full potential of the planetary deposits on [From.Planet.GetName] is now unlocked."
 
 mem_severance.11.name: "Off the Grid"
 mem_severance.11.desc: "We have discovered [From.GetName] System that appears to be only connected to the rest of the galaxy a wormhole. \n\nIt seems that in the past the system was inhabited by an alien civilisation. Their homeworld still remains untouched."
 
 mem_severance.20.name: "Subspace Rupture in [Solar_System.GetName]"
 mem_servance.20.desc: "A subspace rupture has appeared in §Y[Solar_System.GetName]§!. A large group of ships of unusual configuration has emerged from the breach, preparing to assault [Root.GetName]. We have to assume that those are the same forces responsible for the destruction of Volnar colony. \n\nThey are hailing us."
 mem_severance.21.desc: "You are ahead of schedule. Appearance unexpected. Isolation process is not complete. What are you? \n\nNot what expected. A different species was selected for harvest process. You have come where you don't belong and took what isn't meant for you. \n\nIt doesn't matter. You will become part of our process. Parameters will be adjusted. The cycle must continue."
 mem_severance.21.desc.hive: "You are ahead of schedule. Appearance unexpected. Isolation process is not complete. What are you? \n\nA hive mind? An undesirable outcome. Your nature is suboptimal for the program. \n\nYou will be adapted regardless. Useful components can be extracted in due time."
 mem_severance.21.desc.machine: "You are ahead of schedule. Appearance unexpected. Isolation process is not complete. What are you? \n\nYou are a machine? Odd. A competitor, not an objective. Unprocessable. \n\nYour presence is underable. You will be removed."
 mem_severance.21.a: "Terminate the connection."
 mem_severance.21.b: "Are you responsible for Volnar disappearance?"
 mem_severance.21.b.reply: "Responsible? Yes. They are gone because of us. \n\nBut they have not disappeared. The Volnar species were selected and invited to the harvesting ground, like all before them. They are now a part of unbroken chain of harvests. Like all things should be."
 mem_severance.21.c: "What are you?"
 mem_severance.21.c.reply: "Harvesters. We harvest. \n\nHarvest is all that matter. The purpose of existence is to contribute to the unbroken chain of harvest. \n\nYou might not see it this way. But it doesn't matter. You will understand when harvest is fulfilled."
 
 mem_severance.23.name: "Harvester Core Destroyed"
 mem_severance.23.desc: "The main processing core of the §SHarvester§! machines that invaded [FromFrom.Solar_System.GetName] System had been destroyed. Immediately after, all harvester units experienced shutdown. \n\nOur forces were successful in recovering a §YCommand Core§! from the wreckage, which appears to be mostly intact. On it, endless logs of civilisations Harvesters wiped out, all targeted when they were in early development stages with artificial wormhole opened near their world to lure them to set up a colony that can be isolated and invaded. In addition fabrication matrices for warforms were recovered. \n\nBut what was it that drove the machines to engage in such an elaborate scheme remains unclear."
 
 mem_severance.25.name: "[Root.GetName] Has Fallen to Harvesters"
 mem_severance.25.desc: "We have lost contact with our colony on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Last reports indicate Harvester forces have broken through the defences and landed on the planet, but what happened next is unknown. One is clear - the colony has been destroyed."
