 mem_demon_ship_event.1.name:0 "Lost Prototype Ship Discovered"
 mem_demon_ship_event.1.desc:0 "§Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! is ecstatic. After more thorough scans the anomaly turns out to be a spaceship, and even more intriguing is the fact that it is one of ours. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! recognizes it as one of our prototype FTL-capable ships thought to be lost on a testflight years ago. Its orbit is unstable and the ship is slowly descending into the atmosphere. It seems to be undamaged but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing. In order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew its orbit has to be stabilized first. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! already came up with a plan."

 mem_demon_ship_event.4.desc:0 "An urgent message from Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!. The crew is dead. Their mutilated corpses float through the depressurized sections of the ship. As there is no decay in vaccum §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! can only guess for how long they have been dead. It remains a mystery for now why there is no atmosphere as the ship´s hull appears intact. The ship seems to have run out of energy a while ago. It will take some time before we will know more."

 mem_demon_ship_event.5.name:0 "Grim Discoveries"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.desc:0 "All energy cells were exhausted and some of them had to be replaced with reserve cells from the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to get at least some of the ships systems online. The logbook shows the crew joking in joyful anticipation of their first ftl-flight, but then all recordings broke up shortly after the ship´s ftl engines were activated. It is hard to assess how much time had passed before the recordings start again. The flight seems to be over and the atmosphere has changed completely. Those same faces smiling a moment ago are now distorted by pain and screams echo as they mutilate themselves. The recording ends abruptly. Shall we investigate further or leave the dead to rest?"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.a:0 "Destroy the ship. No one must know what was found."

 mem_demon_ship_event.6.a:0 "May they find peace."
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! comes to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. While overseeing more data a feeling of a dark presence overcomes §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and their assistants. They quickly remove the datacore to take it with them to the §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Right after returning to their ship our science team monitors an energy spike inside the prototypes ftl core. They initiate emergency undocking procedures, which they barely manage to complete before the ship vanishes into the void. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been changed by strange dimensional energies. Might it be alive? We may never know, but the retrieved datacore provides significant data on ftl travel."

 mem_demon_ship_event.8.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! comes to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. While overseeing some more data he is interrupted by noise of the crew fighting and screaming. One of the scientist´s assistants had gone mad trying to destroy the §Y[Root.GetName]§! while shouting out shredded sentences about how the prototype demanded more passengers to the "Other Side". With luck and some injuries the rest of the team manages to confine him aboard the scienceship. After this event §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have brought with it from this "Other Side" using the ship's self destruct device. We might never know what exactly happened to the ship and its crew but our science team is alive and chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!´s colleague is on the way to recovery."

The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. The transmission of science data changes into a video transmission at the end. The chief scientist stands in front of the camera holding their own eyes in their hands while speaking in a low voice: "We go now to the Other Side". Agonizing screams from the science team echo through the transmission before it ends. Recovery teams searching for our science ship found no traces..."

 mem_dimensional_rift_event.2.desc:0 "The last of the station's logs seems to be a closing statement, indicating the completion of all research and the shutdown of the facility. The data in the file seems to indicate that multiple time-space rifts tore apart significant areas of the station's outer hull, resulting in many casualties. Data about the test itself seems to be redacted or lost. Whatever tore this station apart, we cannot be certain. Nevertheless, we have gained vast insight about warp fields and purported loopholes in the laws of physics."

Despite our host's best efforts, some of their unruliest scientists managed to sneak a few addictive substances through security and heightened hostilities lead to a few violent confrontations between their rival researchers. Our own scientists could barely get a word in edgewise, and many generally regard the event as a ‘total waste of time'. Perhaps it'd be best not to attend next time."
 mem_sciencecon.5.a:0 "Absolutely reprehensible."

 mem_sciencecon.6.name:0 "A total catastrophe!"
 mem_sciencecon.6.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was an absolute failure. Despite having strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, our security team allowed various drugs to be transported into the convention, causing widespread chaos and several hospitilizations. What's more, a respect scientist among our staff attempted to impress a potential mate by prematurely activating an experimental weapon of his own design. The weapon promptly exploded, causing widespread panic, injuring several researchers and killing said scientist. The Convention was evacuated early and many of our science officers had to be taken into custody."

The Convention has been deemed as a national failure the likes of which have never been seen before and many of our invited guests have come to view us poorly as a result. It may take some time to erase this black mark off of our reputation."

 mem_sciencecon.6.b.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences we attended was abhorrent at best and a direct insult to our people at worst. Our host's scientists were irresponsible and juvenile, casually wielding dangerous technologies and putting others at risk for the satisfaction of their petty rivalries. One individual in particular's attempt to impress a potential mate resulted in several injuries and the loss of their own life, putting a premature and swift end to the event. Whether this was some kind of joke in poor taste or an intended affront to our people, several of our scientists don't believe it worth the effort to maintain diplomatic relations with the §Y[invite_sender.GetName]§!"
 mem_sciencecon.6.a:0 "An embarrassment of colossal proportions."

 asteroid_structure_network_desc:0 "Our science ship has detected a strange network of structures on the surface of the asteroid that appear to be artificial in origin. Perhaps this is worth investigating."

 mem_anomaly_failure.10.name:0 "Asteroid Collision"
 mem_anomaly_failure.10.desc:0 "The apparent network of structures was little more than a deformity in the shape of the asteroid’s surface, apparently the result of an impact in the last few million years. Asteroid collisions in a system this old are rare, but not particularly noteworthy."
 mem_anomaly_failure.10.a:0 "Oh well."

 mem_anomaly_event.10.name:0 "Asteroid Weapon"
 mem_anomaly_event.10.desc:0 "The artificial structures are only found on one side of the asteroid. Our best guess is that they are a network of carefully concealed engines. Though capable of limited thrust, they seem to be perfect for directing an object this large at a destination over an extended period of time, without the detectable emissions of a traditional method of interstellar propulsion. Radar and gravimetric telemetry have also revealed that the core of the asteroid is much denser than it should be, if it was a natural formation.\n\nOur working theory is that this was a weapon targeted at a planet, moon, or large station disguised to look like a wayward asteroid at first. Only once it had impacted would its nature as a targeted kinetic kill vehicle be revealed. With its original core replaced by heavier elements like tungsten, it would have enough mass to potentially render an entire world uninhabitable. Its existence, and the fact that its fuel pods are empty, imply that it missed its target. Study of the engine of this planet-killer weapon has yielded some intriguing details."

 mem_anomaly_event.11.desc:0 "Upon closer inspection, the crashed object on the surface of the asteroid turned out to be an alien probe! Along with rudimentary solar collection and radio reception and transmission technology, the probe also contains a flat, grooved disc mounted on the side. Spinning the disk elicits a deluge of sounds. [Root.GetLeaderName] believes it to be an alien form of music!\n\nUnfortunately, this music isn't very good, or at least is geared towards audio sensory equipment vastly dissimilar to our own. Still, a cultural artifact from a completely different species...that's something, right?"

 mem_anomaly_event.12.name:0 "Escape Pod"
 mem_anomaly_event.12.desc:0 "An expedition sent to explore the wreck on the surface of the asteroid brought back an interesting find. It appears to be an emergency craft, judging by the lack of substantive propulsion systems, on board of which several pods capable of sustained cryogenic suspension were found. Most had been dismantled into servicing a single, jury-rigged pod, containing one occupant; although the system strained to keep them alive, by our best estimations the cryogenic system failed over five hundred years ago. Little can be determined from the creature’s dessicated remains, with stellar radiation having sterilized most of its tissues.\n\nAll's not lost, however, as the pure inventive genius of the improvised system has aided our knowledge of long-term system maintainability and cryogenics."
