 mem_black_hole_1_desc:0 "The black hole [Root.GetName] appears to have a small object orbiting just outside the event horizon. Upon closer examination, it appears to be a small, ancient wormhole generator built by an unknown civilization, possibly as a way of opening a path into the event horizon and investigating what lies beyond. Our scientists would like to examine the technology closer."

 mem_demon_ship_event.1.name:0 "Lost Prototype Ship Discovered"
 mem_demon_ship_event.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] is ecstatic. After more thorough scans the anomaly turns out to be a spaceship, and even more intriguing is the fact that it is one of ours. [Root.GetLeaderName] recognizes it as one of our prototype FTL-capable ships thought to be lost on a testflight years ago. Its orbit is unstable and the ship is slowly descending into the atmosphere. It seems to be undamaged but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing. In order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew its orbit has to be stabilized first. [Root.GetLeaderName] already came up with a plan."

 mem_demon_ship_event.4.desc:0 "An urgent message from Scientist [Root.GetLeaderName]. The crew is dead. Their mutilated corpses float through the depressurized sections of the ship. As there is no decay in vaccum [Root.GetLeaderName] can only guess for how long they have been dead. It remains a mystery for now why there is no atmosphere as the ship´s hull appears intact. The ship seems to have run out of energy a while ago. It will take some time before we will know more."

 mem_demon_ship_event.5.name:0 "Grim Discoveries"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.desc:0 "All energy cells were exhausted and some of them had to be replaced with reserve cells from the [Root.GetName] to get at least some of the ships systems online. The logbook shows the crew joking in joyful anticipation of their first ftl-flight, but then all recordings broke up shortly after the ship´s ftl engines were activated. It is hard to assess how much time had passed before the recordings start again. The flight seems to be over and the atmosphere has changed completely. Those same faces smiling a moment ago are now distorted by pain and screams echo as they mutilate themselves. The recording ends abruptly. Shall we investigate further or leave the dead to rest?"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.a:0 "Destroy the ship. No one must know what was found."

 mem_demon_ship_event.7.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event [Root.GetLeaderName] comes to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. While overseeing more data a feeling of a dark presence overcomes [Root.GetLeaderName] and their assistants. They quickly remove the datacore to take it with them to the [Root.GetName]. Right after returning to their ship our science team monitors an energy spike inside the prototypes ftl core. Beeing totally perplex where it got the energy from they barely manage to undock from it before it vanishes into the void. [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been changed by strange dimensional energies. Might it be alive? We may never know, but the retrieved datacore provides significant data on ftl travel."
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.a:0 "Our knowledge expands!"
 mem_demon_ship_event.8.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship_event.8.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event [Root.GetLeaderName] comes to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. While overseeing some more data he is interrupted by noise of the crew fighting and screaming. One of the scientist´s assistants had gone mad trying to destroy the [Root.GetName] while shouting out shredded sentences about how the prototype demanded more passengers to the "Other Side". With luck and some injuries the rest of the team manages to confine him aboard the scienceship. After this event [Root.GetLeaderName] chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have brought with it from this "Other Side" using the ship's self destruct device. We might never know what exactly happened to the ship and it´s crew but our science team is alive and chief scientist [Root.GetLeaderName]´s colleague is on the way to recovery."

 mem_demon_ship_event.9.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event [Root.GetLeaderName] came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. The transmission of science data changes into a video transmission at the end. The chief scientist stands in front of the camera holding their own eyes in their hands while speaking in a low voice: "We go now to the Other Side". Agonizing screams from the science team echo through the transmission before it ends. Recovery teams searching for our scienceship found no traces..."

With most of the circuits powering the hydraulic doors fried, the station is still uninhabitable and impossible to investigate further than the breached central control room. The crew now requests permission to inspect the remaining data files."

The data in the file seems to indicate that multiple time-space rifts tore apart significant areas of the station's outer hull, resulting in many casualties. Data about the test itself seems to be redacted or lost. Whatever tore this station apart, we cannot be certain.

Though our scientists' presence was negligible when compared to that of [invite_sender.GetName]'s researchers, they were nevertheless an astoundingly gracious host. The free flow and exchange of ideas was immensely beneficial to our various lines of research and the [invite_sender.GetAdj] lectures were enlightening beyond what even our most staunch optimists believed they would be. The opinion of many of our scientists has changed drastically for the better in their regards, and many would not mind repeating this event in the near future."

Though the security team was under strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, someone nevertheless managed to sneak some in, leading to the inebriation and public embarrassment of several scientists. What's more, it seems that our researchers have developed somewhat of a rivalry with each other based on their respective fields and many of our physicists caused a scene when they provoked our engineering department."
 #Message for the invited to see
 mem_sciencecon.5.a.desc:0 "The Convention for Interdisciplinary Sciences was somewhat of a failure. Despite our host's best efforts, some of their unruliest scientists managed to sneak a few addictive substances through security and heightened hostilities lead to a few violent confrontations between their rival researchers.

Despite having strict orders not to allow any substances inside the building, our security team allowed various drugs to be transported into the convention, causing widespread chaos and several hospitilizations. What's more, a respect scientist among our staff attempted to impress a potential mate by prematurely activating an experimental weapon of his own design. The weapon promptly exploded, causing widespread panic, injuring several researchers and killing said scientist. The Convention was evacuated early and many of our science officers had to be taken into custody. The Convention has been deemed as a national failure the likes of which have never been seen before and many of our invited guests have come to view us poorly as a result. It may take some time to erase this black mark off of our reputation."

Our host's scientists were irresponsible and juvenile, casually wielding dangerous technologies and putting others at risk for the satisfaction of their petty rivalries. One individual in particular's attempt to impress a potential mate resulted in several injuries and the loss of their own life, putting a premature and swift end to the event. Whether this was some kind of joke in poor taste or an intended affront to our people, several of our scientists don't believe it worth the effort to maintain diplomatic relations with the [invite_sender.GetName]"
