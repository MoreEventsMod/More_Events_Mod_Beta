 mem_accelerated_evolution.1.desc:0 "After several months of living on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, the colonists noticed something odd about the surrounding environment. Species seem to drastically change from one month to the next. On the order of the colony's administration, a quick study was performed. It revealed that native flora and fauna possess incredibly fast evolutionary processes. It appears that all species on this world share shorter than average life cycles along with rapid sexual and asexual reproduction, which means that their evolutionary cycle is significantly faster than normal. As a result, the natural environment of this planet is in a constant state of flux.\n\nOn the one hand, the repeatedly adapting local biosphere prevents the colonists from ever truly fitting in - nothing with an ordinary evolutionary cycle could. On the other, studying the constant evolution and rapid breeding of the local animals could lead to advancements in farming and evolutionary science. Either way, the biosphere of a planet is too complicated to change on this sort of scale. The colonists are saddled with this, for good or ill."
