 # Fainthearted Backwater Localisation
 origin_mem_fainthearted: "Fainthearted Backwater"
 origin_mem_fainthearted_desc: "Ages ago, a terrible and ancient invader terrorized the galaxy. While other empires united and attempted a final stand, this civilizaion quaked in fear at the onslaught and retreated to their secluded home system, successfully hiding and waiting out the galatic crisis. For untold millennia their people hid, establishing small, close-knit communities and slowly losing much of their accumulated knowledge, only keeping their advanced sensor stations running at full capacity. Once they finally established that this cycle was free of the menace, they emerged from their obscurity to try to reassert their place among the stars."

 START_SCREEN_MEM_FAINTHEARTED: "When the evil ones came, we couldn't bring ourselves to turn our people to the violence that was demanded by the other empires. Fearfully we emptied our holdings and took our people back to the warm embrace of our homeworld.\n\nWe eschewed dangerous and visible technologies in favor of safety. Our technology might have regressed over the centuries, but we are still here. This is something many of the other races cannot claim...\n\nIt was marked as a day of joy in our history when observers reported having received subspace broadcasts claiming the defeat of the ancient menace.\n\nYears of hard work an redevelopment have let us reclaim our solar system. Now, finally, we are comfortable enough to return to the prosperity of the stars."

 mem_vazurans_category_5: "During the survey of our long forsaken colony surface scans revealed several well-maintained and seemingly active structures.
