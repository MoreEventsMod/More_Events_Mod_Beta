 mem_black_hole_1_desc:0 "The black hole [Root.GetName] appears to have a small object orbiting just outside the event horizon. Upon closer examination, it appears to be a small, ancient wormhole generator built by an unknown civilization, possibly as a way of opening a path into the event horizon and investigating what lies beyond. Our scientists would like to examine the technology closer."

It seems to be undamaged but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing. In order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew its orbit has to be stabilized first. [Root.GetLeaderName] already came up with a plan."

It is hard to assess how much time had passed before the recordings start again. The flight seems to be over and the atmosphere has changed completely.

They quickly remove the datacore to take it with them to the [Root.GetName]. Right after returning to their ship our science team monitors an energy spike inside the prototypes FTL core. They initiate emergency undocking procedures, which they barely manage to complete before the ship vanishes into the void. [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been changed by strange dimensional energies. Might it be alive? We may never know, but the retrieved datacore provides significant data on FTL travel."

One of the scientist´s assistants had gone mad trying to destroy the [Root.GetName] while shouting out shredded sentences about how the prototype demanded more passengers to the "Other Side". With luck and some injuries the rest of the team manages to confine him aboard the scienceship. After this event [Root.GetLeaderName] chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have brought with it from this "Other Side" using the ship's self destruct device.

Radar and gravimetric telemetry have also revealed that the core of the asteroid is much denser than it should be, if it was a natural formation.\n\nOur working theory is that this was a weapon targeted at a planet, moon, or large station disguised to  like a wayward asteroid at first. Only once it had impacted would its nature as a targeted kinetic kill vehicle be revealed. With its original core replaced by heavier elements like tungsten, it would have enough mass to potentially render an entire world uninhabitable.

It appears to be an emergency craft, judging by the lack of substantive propulsion systems, on board of which several pods capable of sustained cryogenic suspension were found. Most had been dismantled into servicing a single, jury-rigged pod, containing one occupant; although the system strained to keep them alive, by our best estimations the cryogenic system failed over five hundred years ago. Little can be determined from the creature’s dessicated remains, with stellar radiation having sterilized most of its tissues.\n\nAll's not lost, however, as the pure inventive genius of the improvised system has aided our knowledge of long-term system maintainability and cryogenics."
