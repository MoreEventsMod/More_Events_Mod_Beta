 #Lost Zoo Anomaly
 #Code and idea by LamilLerran
 #Writing by shockedsystem
 #Note that this comes from a vanilla anomaly category, title "Life Signs" and text
 #"We have detected life signs coming from somewhere beneath the barren and lifeless surface of this §Y[planet/moon]§!. What manner of organism could possibly live there?"

 mem_lost_zoo.8.desc:0 "Further survey has revealed a large complex on the surface consisting of over a dozen collapsed domes, structures that at one point were sealed from the rest of the planet. Excavation into the largest building uncovered an elevator shaft plunging over two hundred meters into the surface."

 MEM_LOST_ZOO_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A deep elevator shaft descends from ruined domes on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. We will need to mount a scientific expedition if we want to know what lies below."
 mem_lost_zoo.1.name:0 "Ancient Zoo"
 mem_lost_zoo.1.desc:0 "An expedition down this shaft has revealed an entire self-contained biome within a gargantuan cavern. Creatures representing at least three separate tropical planets have been catalogued so far. The system is heavily automated, with a multitude of specialized drones observing, maintaining, and at times culling the population, artificially maintaining the food cycle, as well as the facility itself. A thirty-seven hour day/night cycle is simulated using a slow-moving artificial light bar on the roof of the cavern, powered by geothermal taps buried even deeper into the surface.\n\nThis artificial ecosystem is estimated to be over 40,000 years old, and is beginning to break down in ways the automated systems cannot repair. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! estimates that this facility will reach a critical failure point within the next millennium or so."
