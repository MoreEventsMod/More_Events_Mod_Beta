 mem_ark.2.name:0 "Space Oddity"
 mem_ark.2.desc:0 "Beside the primitive civilisation living there, something else about §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has drawn our attention. \n\nA space station is orbiting the planet, way more advanced than any technology the natives have, yet way too primitive to have been built by alien intelligence."
 mem_ark.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_ark.2.a.tooltip:0 "Construct an §SObservation Post§! above the planet or conquer it to find out more."

 mem_ark.4.name:0 "Something That Doesn't Belong"
 mem_ark.4.desc:0 "We have observed §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! for quite a while and have confirmed that the natives have no means of constructing and launching a space station. \n\nSomeone else must've built it above their world."
 mem_ark.4.a:0 "We need to find out more."

 mem_ark.5.desc:0 "Our settlers on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! have confirmed the presence of a primitive space station in orbit above the [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThe [mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] had no means of constructing such a structure, so the question is - who did?"

 MEM_ARK_PROJECT:0 "Investigate the Station"
 MEM_ARK_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A station above §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! looks distinctly out of place - those who could've built it are clearly not advanced enough."

 mem_ark.100.name:0 "The Ark"
 mem_ark.100.desc:0 "The station in orbit of [the_planet.GetName] turns out to be about 500 years old. \n\nFrom what the crew of the [Root.GetName] could gather, the planet actually experienced a nuclear war or similar disaster roughly at the time of station's construction. The species currently known as the [mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] are the descendants of survivors that underwent severe mutations, while the last of the original species, called the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural], found refuge in orbit. \n\nLanding pods filled with cryogenic capsules and various equipment are still attached to the station, waiting for deployment. Seemingly, the maintenance crew that was supposed to launch them ran out of supplies and perished before the surface was deemed habitable. At this stage, any attempt to tamper with the station beside sending the pods down would destroy it."
 mem_ark.100.a:0 "Launch the pods."
 mem_ark.100.a.tooltip:0 "A [mem_ark_sky_people.GetName] £pop  pop will be added to the planet below."
 mem_ark.100.a.delayed:0 "We should launch the pods when we have space."
 mem_ark.100.a.delayed.tooltip:0 "A planetary edict will be added to §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! to release the pods once you have a free tile to host a new £pop  pop."
 mem_ark.100.b:0 "Better not to touch anything."
 mem_ark.100.c:0 "Shut everything down and study the station."
 mem_ark.100.d:0 "Scuttle the station, killing all pod occupants."

 mem_ark.102.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Knowledge is Power"
 mem_ark.102.desc:0 "It appears that, after initial tension between the [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] natives and the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetAdj] newcomers on the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!, they have finally achieved lasting peace. \n\nThe [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] dazzled everyone with various technological gadgets, impressing scientifically-minded [mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] enough for them to ask the newcomers to become their new leaders."
 mem_ark.102.a:0 "A wise choice."
 mem_ark.102.b:0 "Concerning."

 mem_ark.103.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Superior Firepower"
 mem_ark.103.desc:0 "After initial tension between the [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] natives and the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetAdj] newcomers on the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!, the conflict erupted into a full-blown war. \n\nHowever, no matter how many [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] warriors stormed the entrenched newcomers' positions, they were no match for automatic firearms the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] brought with them. Eventually, the natives had no choice but to surrender all power to the invaders."
 mem_ark.103.a:0 "Good show."
 mem_ark.103.b:0 "They may become a threat one day..."
 mem_ark.103.c:0 "Was it really necessary?"

 mem_ark.104.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Peace and Harmony"
 mem_ark.104.desc:0 "The [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] did not have much trouble integrating into [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] society on the surface of §Y[the_planet.GetName]§!. \n\nMost of them seem to be enamoured with the simple and peaceful way of life the [mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] have developed and do not want to go back to the technology level that brought ruin to their civilisation."
 mem_ark.104.a:0 "Good for them."
 mem_ark.104.b:0 "One less threat to worry about."
 mem_ark.104.c:0 "Well, that's stupid."

 mem_ark.105.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Gods from the Sky"
 mem_ark.105.desc:0 "It seems that the [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] were quite lucky. [mem_ark_grounders.GetAdj] culture features imagery of pre-mutation [mem_ark_sky_people.GetAdj] species prominently as a divine form or as saints who inhabited a paradise lost. \n\nNow, as the [mem_ark_grounders.GetNamePlural] suddenly encountered such beings in person, most have sworn fealty to them, calling them returned gods. Most [mem_ark_sky_people.GetNamePlural] seem to be quite comfortable with this development."
 mem_ark.105.a:0 "What heresy is this!"
 mem_ark.105.b:0 "Morons, all of them."
 mem_ark.105.c:0 "Who are we to judge?"

 mem_ark_background_radiation_desc:0 "This planet's radiation level is noticeably elevated. Not enough to make life impossible, it nevertheless can make it unpleasant."
 mem_ark_station_in_orbit:0 "Station in Orbit"
 mem_ark_station_in_orbit_desc:0 "This planet is orbited by a space station that is hard to explain."
