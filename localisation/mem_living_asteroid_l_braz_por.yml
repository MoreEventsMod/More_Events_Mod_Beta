 # Anomaly
 mem_living_asteroid_anomaly_category:0 "Unusual Energy Readings"
 mem_living_asteroid_anomaly_category_desc:0 "Preliminary scans of §Y[From.GetName]§! have shown strange readings. Both it and the smaller surrounding asteroids display energy readings that are not expected from such objects. Furthermore, §Y[From.GetName]§! is covered in patches of strangely coloured and textured material."
 
 # Anomaly Success
 mem_living_asteroid.1.name:0 "Living Asteroids"
 mem_living_asteroid.1.desc:0 "Although chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! insists that the term is not accurate, the crew of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! have already begun to call §Y[From.GetName]§! a 'living asteroid'. Massive portions of the asteroids are home to colonies of hyper-resilient lichen, unlike any form of fungi found on terrestrial planets. \n\nLike all lichens, these 'living asteroids' are formed of a combination of fungus and cyanobacteria, with this particular species of cyanobacteria being only found with the corresponding fungus - both are entirely new species to the [Root.Owner.GetName]. While the proposed scientific term for them is "celestial ascomycota", most media reports and even scientific papers have begun to call them "space mushrooms". Further study is recommended."
 
 # Anomaly Failure
 mem_living_asteroid.2.name:0 "Just a Hunk of Rock"
 mem_living_asteroid.2.desc:0 "Chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has reported that the unusual energy readings from §Y[From.GetName]§! are nothing more than a scanner malfunction. Furthermore, the textured material on the surface of the planet is simply a vein of metal, which wouldn't even be useful for mining."
