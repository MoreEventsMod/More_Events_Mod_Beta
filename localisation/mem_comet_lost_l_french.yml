 #Note for translators: The game will generate a random leader to give comet a name and since it's synched, it will be in English. There's no real reason to keep it beside aesthetics, so make two descriptions based on "mem_comet_lost.1.desc" if it's not apropriate to have latin-lettered name in the event.
 mem_comet_lost.1.a:0 "It will be missed..."
 mem_comet_lost.1.b:0 "Noted"
 mem_comet_lost.1.c:0 "Let it bring joy to alien worlds now."
 mem_comet_lost.1.d:0 "We will follow it to the distant worlds!"
 mem_comet_lost.1.e:0 "Orbital mechanic calculations remain accurate."
