 mem_wpdr.4.name: "Indomitable Valor"
 mem_wpdr.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports successfully boarding and studying the interior of §SIndomitable Valor§! - a massive battleship found in [capital_ship.Solar_System.GetName]. \n\nThe ship was built and operated by the §SUniversal Transport Alliance§!, an organization formed in the aftermath of some kind of galactic political crisis several thousands of years ago. Many powers present at the time have collapsed, leaving trade routes unprotected and vulnerable to rising piracy, until the non-government organization had to step in. The Alliance operated a number of massive capital ships such as the Indomitable Valor, known as §YMobile Weapon Deployment Rigs§!, which manufactured small ships capable of effectively pursuing pirate ships and engage them with long-range weapons. \n\nFor a while, the Alliance was generously financed by governmental and private benefactors and was able to not only push back against piracy, but also invest heavily in their own infrastructure. However, as the pirate threat diminished and the Alliance's power grew, various forces became dissatisfied with UTA's dominance and demanded its dissolution. Most of the officers eventually defected to their native empires, and those who didn't were hunted down. The Indomitable Valor was the last surviving Rig that defended Alliance's headquarters. It seems that its enemies opted to not pursue the lone ship and over time the crew abandoned it or died, leaving it in automatic defense mode. \n\nNow, the ship is damaged beyond repair. We were, however, able to extract the Manufacturing Matrix responsible for creating new platforms."
 mem_wpdr.4.a: "Bring it to our home world."
 mem_wpdr.5.name: "Indomitable Battlegroup"
 mem_wpdr.5.desc: "We have encountered a group of ships stationed in a §Y[From.GetName]§! system lead by an enormous vessel. Scans revealed extensive shipbuilding capabilities, blurring the lines between a ship and a starbase. \n\nOur automatic transponder identifies this ship as the §SIndomitable Valor§!, which along with its escorts forms the §SIndomitable Battlegroup§!. Its intentions appear hostile."
 mem_wpdr.5.a: "This thing is huge!"
