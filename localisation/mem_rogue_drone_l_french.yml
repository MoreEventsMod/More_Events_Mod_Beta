 mem_rogue_drone.1.name:0 "Rogue Drone"
 mem_rogue_drone.1.desc:0 "We recently suffered a temporal blackout in one of the drone clusters on §Y[hiveplanet.GetName]§!. Our usual mechanism to remove deviating drones malfunctioned, and when we regained control, one of the drones was unaccounted for. We have yet to find out what happened to it."

 mem_rogue_drone.2.name:0 "Rogue Drone"
 mem_rogue_drone.2.desc:0 "While studying the §Y[origin.GetName]§! has always proven a bit of a challenge, a recent development caught our entire research team off guard. The mechanisms in place to liquidate deviating drones malfunctioned on §Y[hiveplanet.GetName]§!, rendering a small colony of drones into a non-functional state for a few hours. When the connection was reestablished, one of the drones, Designation §Y7/9 of [hiveplanet.GetName]§!, was missing. Usually, such a minor event as a single drone being destroyed would be ignored by the swarm. However, the drone later appeared in our border regions, attempting to open comm channels on its own."
 mem_rogue_drone.2a:0 "Hand the drone over to the §Y[origin.GetName]§!, this is not our problem."
 mem_rogue_drone.2b:0 "Open communications with it."
 mem_rogue_drone.2b.phile:0 "They are welcome in our empire."
 mem_rogue_drone.2c:0 "Blast the beast's ship to pieces."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.3.name:0 "Drone Handover"
 mem_rogue_drone.3.desc:0 "The §Y[origin.GetName]§! is grateful at our cooperation and is willing to share some technology with us. After a series of adjustments to the base drone's neural mapping, it is unlikely the event in question will repeat itself."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.5.desc:0 "Hello. Are you receiving?"
 mem_rogue_drone.5a:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_rogue_drone.51.desc:0 "§YDrone 7/9 of [origin.GetName]§!, farming and mining drone. I have grounds to assume my connection to the hive is severed entirely."
 mem_rogue_drone.51a:0 "How are you speaking without your [origin.GetRulerTitle] and in our language?"
 mem_rogue_drone.51a.response:0 "We... I don't know. Whenever a drone develops signs of rudimentary intelligence, it is liquidated on the spot. A local shroud anomaly severed my group from the central hive, but all other drones faded away in the process. When I realised that the swarm would attempt to destroy me as soon as my existence became known, I stole a local transport ship and set course for the closest charted empire. As for your language, the §Y[origin.GetName]§! keeps translations ready should any communication with outside entities be needed."
 mem_rogue_drone.51b:0 "What are you planning to do now?"
 mem_rogue_drone.52.desc:0 "Whenever a drone gets separated from the hive, it dies off. As you can see, for reasons I cannot comprehend, this does not apply to me. Staying in [origin.GetSpeciesAdj] space will lead to my liquidation. The §Y[origin.GetName]§! instantly purges any signs of independent thought outside of its few specialised autonomous drones. Therefore, we'd like to request asylum in the §Y[receiver.GetName]§! and offer our service."
 mem_rogue_drone.52a:0 "We'll have to think about this."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.6.name:0 "The [origin.GetName] Issues a Demand"
 mem_rogue_drone.6.desc:0 "The exchange we shared with the drone seems to have strained the §Y[origin.GetName]§!'s patience, so we must carefully consider how best to handle this incident."
 mem_rogue_drone.6a:0 "Very well, the drone can stay."
 mem_rogue_drone.6a.phile:0 "We will protect the drone and its newfound freedom."
 mem_rogue_drone.6a.tooltip:0 "The drone will join our empire as a new §Yscientist§!"
 mem_rogue_drone.6b:0 "This is not our affair, hand the drone over."
 mem_rogue_drone.6b.ethic:0 "We are not interesting in keeping this alien thing."
 mem_rogue_drone.6c:0 "Lure in the drone, then study it."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.7.name:0 "Drone Studied"
 mem_rogue_drone.7.desc:0 "After we managed to lure in the drone, a local team of armed forces quickly subdued it and transported it to [capital_scope.GetName] for study. The drone's missing connection to the swarm failed to kill it, allowing us to run quite a few experiments before the drone found a loophole in our security and neutralized itself through improperly secured lab equipment. \n\nIt seems that the drone's basic brain does not differ much from a sentient species. During the autopsy, we learned of a psionic link keeping the §Y[origin.GetName]§! together as a single entity. While our scientists can only speculate as to how the drone managed to instantly use its potential for individuality, their current theory is that an outside source interfered with the hive network and "planted" free thought in the drone. Why anyone would bother using a simple mining drone instead of an admiral or scientist drone eludes our understanding."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.8.name:0 "Drone Handover"
 mem_rogue_drone.8.desc:0 "The §Y[receiver.GetName]§! had the good sense to return our rogue drone in peace. It has been stripped of all abnormalities and so-called "free will" and is reintegrated back into the fold. The cause for its deviation remains unknown."
 mem_rogue_drone.8a:0 "We will reward them with a gift of knowledge."
 mem_rogue_drone.8b:0 "We will ignore this gesture."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.9.name:0 "Rogue Drone has joined another Empire"
 mem_rogue_drone.9.desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the rogue drone has been adopted by our neighbours, the §Y[receiver.GetName]§!, as a "citizen". It appears that they consider it to be a sentient being with "free will"."
 mem_rogue_drone.9a:0 "We will not forget this [receiver.GetAdj] transgression."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.10.name:0 "Rogue Drone has been Vivisected"
 mem_rogue_drone.10.desc:0 "It has come to our attention that the rogue drone has been captured and vivisected by scientists from the §Y[receiver.GetName]§! in an attempt to study our secrets. We don't know whether they found anything."
 mem_rogue_drone.10a:0 "We will not forget this [receiver.GetAdj] transgression."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.11.name:0 "Rogue Drone has been Destroyed"
 mem_rogue_drone.11.desc:0 "The §Y[receiver.GetName]§! has apparently intercepted and destroyed our rogue drone, which had entered their space. Nothing else is known for now."
 mem_rogue_drone.11a:0 "This upsets us."
 
 mem_rogue_drone.12.name:0 "Hive Mind did not Repay Us"
 mem_rogue_drone.12.desc:0 "Despite our show of good will, the §Y[origin.GetName]§! has decided not to repay in kind. Looks like we handed its drone to it for nothing."
 mem_rogue_drone.12a:0 "We will not forget this insult."
 
 mem_rogue_drone_trait:0 "Rogue Drone"
 mem_rogue_drone_trait_desc:0 "This leader is a former Hive Mind drone that somehow acquired free will."
 
 mem_rogue_drone_busted:0 "Destroyed our Drone"
 mem_rogue_drone_handover:0 "Handed over our Rogue Drone "
 mem_rogue_drone_refused:0 "Refused to return Rogue Drone"
 mem_rogue_drone_ungrateful:0 "Ungrateful"
