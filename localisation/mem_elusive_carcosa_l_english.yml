 mem_elusive_carcosa.11.name:0 "Inspiration or Delusion?"
 mem_elusive_carcosa.11.desc:0 "Following the recent passing of a respected science officer, the recovery of various notes and documents from the late scientist's lab paints a curious picture. It seems that, in their twilight years, they developed an odd obsession with a creature they named the 'Elusive Carcosa'. It is difficult to decipher what exactly was so unique about this animal, but the late scientist seems to have regarded its acquisition as a top priority.\n\nAccording to the notes, the creature was last sighted on [mem_carcosa_colony.GetName]. With the use of a research vessel's sensors, finding it should be trivial."
 mem_elusive_carcosa.11.a:0 "There may be something to this."

 mem_elusive_carcosa.12.name:0 "The Elusive Carcosa"
 mem_elusive_carcosa.12.desc:0 "Our investigation on [mem_carcosa_colony.GetName] did not yield any results; however, there have been some odd reports from [mem_carcosa_colony_2.GetName]. Several colonists have claimed to have spotted a mysterious creature that they say matches our summary of the notes on the Elusive Carcosa, but when we compare their reports to these notes, none seem to match in either appearance or behaviour. Though [mem_carcosa_colony_2.GetName]'s scientific director swears that he double-checked each sighting himself, the only possible conclusion is a severe oversight by all personnel involved."
 mem_elusive_carcosa.12.default:0 "How odd."
 mem_elusive_carcosa.12.mat:0 "An unforgivable waste of resources."
 mem_elusive_carcosa.12.col:0 "Perhaps it's time to find a more suitable [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] for the job."

 mem_elusive_carcosa.13.name:0 "Regenerating Molluscoid"
 mem_elusive_carcosa.13.flav1:0 "We've been receiving word of a new species of molluscoid living on [mem_carcosa_colony_3.GetName]. If reports are to be believed, the animal is several feet long, aquatic in nature and has the ability to heal minor injuries. Though many colonists are ardent in their claims that the animal exists, conclusive proof has yet to be found."
 mem_elusive_carcosa.13.flav2:0 "A new fantastical manner of beast seems to have been found on [mem_carcosa_colony_4.GetName]. Though descriptions of it match the ones coming from [mem_carcosa_colony_3.GetName], scientists are hesitant to declare it the same animal, as it seems unlikely if not downright impossible for it to have appeared or evolved on both planets at the same time.\n\nA significant difference between the two seems to be that this new species is allegedly able to harness huge amounts of bioelectricity, which it uses to hunt for prey. Many of our people doubt it even exists at all due to a lack of evidence and discrepancies between the various eyewitness testimonies."
 mem_elusive_carcosa.13.flav3:0 "Just as reports from [mem_carcosa_colony_4.GetName] seemed to be dying down, claims have emerged that a third version of the creature has been found in a sparsely inhabited region on [mem_carcosa_colony_5.GetName]. Just like the other two versions, the creature has been described as a tall mammalian with bioelectrical abilities and can't seem to be found outside of local tales. \n\nOur government officials note that these sightings began shortly after the creature's rise in popularity among our public and that it is very unlikely for them to have any basis in reality."

Our communication channels have been bombarded with reports of the Carcosa's supposed location, but when reviewed, no two descriptions match.\n\nA metaphorical gold fever has gripped our population as the paradoxical nature of this creature becomes steadily more apparent. Something has to be done about this, and quickly."

 mem_elusive_carcosa.18.desc:0 "Eureka! Just as we thought that our efforts to identify the nature of the Elusive Carcosa had amounted to nothing, a new lead has granted us vital insight.\n\nA young researcher working on [mem_carcosa_colony_4.GetName] recently came forward with a new theory of theirs based on the Observer Effect. This theory supposes the animal's existence to be extradimensional, leading to an extraordinary conclusion: The animal possesses the ability to manipulate information about itself, defining its own existence and making it extremely difficult to identify and capture.\n\nIt is, in essence, the first living example of a memetic being ever found by the [Root.GetName]."

 mem_elusive_carcosa.19.name:0 "Memetic Overload Proposal"
 mem_elusive_carcosa.19.desc:0 "For the past few months, our scientists have been hard at work analyzing the Elusive Carcosa's patterns. Though the theory our researcher on [mem_carcosa_colony_4.GetName] developed was uniquely insightful, it was by no means comprehensive and a lot of work is still required to fully understand the animal's abilities.\n\nNevertheless, our scientists have had a recent breakthrough - though we cannot stop the Carcosa from modifying its own characteristics, it cannot stop others from doing so either. Our top experts believe that we may be able to capture the specimen by using quantum computations to change it faster than it can change itself and thereby stabilizing it in an observable form.\n\nThe process is both highly experimental and resource-intensive, but the potential for knowledge that we could garner from this creature may well be worth it."

 mem_elusive_carcosa.20.name:0 "Carcosa Captured"
 mem_elusive_carcosa.20.desc:0 "Success! As the quantum supercomputer hummed to life, it began changing every mention of the Elusive Carcosa to a pre-generated description at a rate of hundreds of millions of times per second, leaving absolutely no chance for the creature to adapt itself. What's more, just a few hours after the machine was turned on, a creature matching its generated description was secured in a remote rural area of [mem_carcosa_colony_capture.GetName]!\n\nAs far as our scientists can tell, the creature did not originate in our dimension or even our universe, but was somehow transported here by unknown means. Wherever it hails from, it is a place ruled by perception rather than physics, explaining its supernatural abilities - when it was displaced, it gained a physical form but did not lose its original powers.\n\nWe can learn much from the Carcosa, but it is unlikely that we'll be able to use its exotic aspects to the same degree it does. What should we focus on?"
