 mem_star_survey.1.name:0 "Survey The Stars"
 mem_star_survey.1.desc:0 "For millennia we have looked at the stars trying to understand them, but they were always beyond our reach. Now we finally have the technology to do so! Some of our best scientists are eager to go on an expedition to examine the stellar bodies up close. They have already prepared a list of nearby stars of different types that would be the best targets to study."
 mem_star_survey.1.a:0 "Very thoughtful. Let's see that list."
 mem_star_survey.1.b:0 "Our best scientists have more important things to do."
 mem_star_survey.2.name:0 "A-class star studied"
 mem_star_survey.2.desc:0 "This very bright star will probably burn out in a few million years (which is very soon in the astronomic scale), as the fusion processes in its core are extremely fast. During the examination of [From.From.GetName], science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] noticed that onboard solar collectors generated 150% of the normal amount of energy. It wouldn't be surprising, considering the radiation present, but it's interesting that they didn't melt..."
 mem_star_survey.2.a:0 "Transfer the bonus energy to our banks."
 mem_star_survey.2.b:0 "Study them further."
 mem_star_survey.3.name:0 "K-class star studied"
 mem_star_survey.3.desc:0 "Just as we expected, the radiation spectrum of this star is very conductive to carbon-oxygen life similar to us. The zone of perfect conditions is wide. We should look for these stars in the future as they tend to have the highest potential for having colonizable planets."
 mem_star_survey.4.name:0 "M-class star studied"
 mem_star_survey.4.desc:0 "This type of star is old and the fusion processes in its core have slowed down. This allowed us to fly up much closer and study the fusion in greater detail."
 mem_star_survey.5.name:0 "Compact star studied"
 mem_star_survey.5.desc:0 "This star is a sad reminder that all things in the universe are finite. Once a shining star, at the end of its lifespan it collapsed into itself. While studying this exotic celestial body, our science officer [Root.GetLeaderName] found new fascination in Particle Research."
 mem_star_survey.6.name:0 "Star studies completed"
 mem_star_survey.6.desc.spirit:0 "We have finally finished our studies of different types of stars. The data collected, as well as the images captured by our researchers gave us all a new appreciation for the lights that shine in the vast darkness of space. We have instructed our preachers to share this insight with our general population."
 mem_star_survey.6.desc.mat:0 "We have finally finished our studies of different types of stars. A special research group was formed to further analyze all the collected data. The group could focus on furthering our understanding of physical processes that happen in the stars' cores. However, one of our science officers suggested that their time could be better used to fine-tune our powerplants. That will put us above the projected energetic budget for a couple of years, which would lead directly to increased energy credit."
 mem_star_survey.6.desc.default:0 "We have finally finished our studies of different types of stars. A special research group was formed to further analyze all the collected data. The group will focus on furthering our understanding of physical processes that happen in the stars' cores."
 mem_star_survey.6.a:0 "Let us push the limits of science!"
 mem_star_survey.6.b:0 "We could always use more energy."
 mem_star_survey.6.c:0 "May the light guide us."
