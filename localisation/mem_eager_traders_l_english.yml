 mem_eager_traders.1.name:0 "Eager Entrepreneurs at our Borders"
 mem_eager_traders.1.desc:0 "A safe passage from §Y[ruthcap.GetAdj]§! lands to ours had barely been secured, when we received worrying reports from customs on the border. Hundreds of heat signals were detected rapidly approaching our territory, all of them identified as civilian freighters. The local customs officers seem at a loss and fear the incoming tide of merchants could overwhelm their small border control."
 mem_eager_traders.1.xenophile:0 "They are that eager to meet us? Very well, open the border."
 mem_eager_traders.1.xenophobe:0 "Reinforce the border controls and make them turn back!"
 mem_eager_traders.1.individualist:0 "These controls merely hinder trade. Open the border for now."
 mem_eager_traders.1.fanindividualist:0 "I can't hear you over the sound of our own freighters departing."
 mem_eager_traders.2.name:0 "Undercut Economy"
 mem_eager_traders.2.desc:0 "It seems that letting in that torrent of §Y[ruthcap.GetAdj]§! merchants some months ago has harmed our economy. Their wares have been nothing but overpriced trinkets or faulty equipment that is starting to break down, and a multitude of hostile takeovers and squeeze-outs have resulted in monopolies on our planets. We foresee it will take a few years for our economy to recover from this setback."
 mem_eager_traders.3.name:0 "A Strange Equilibrium"
 mem_eager_traders.3.desc:0 "Now that trade between the §Y[ruthcap.GetName]§! and us is well under way, it seems that we have both been peddling each other useless goods. We ended up neither losing nor making any money out of the transactions, but the §Y[ruthcap.GetName]§! citizens seem amused."
 mem_eager_traders.1.resigned:0 "Send some officers to help ease their burden."
 mem_eager_traders.2.annoyed:0 "That is less than ideal."
 mem_eager_traders.2.fascinated:0 "And we fell for their ruse? Fascinating."
 mem_eager_traders.4.name:0 "Mind over Materialism"
 mem_eager_traders.4.desc:0 "The §Y[ruthcap.GetAdj]§! merchants we allowed access to our markets some months ago turned out to be peddling nothing but overpriced luxuries and trinkets. Fortunately, it seems our population has little interest in their wares, and the traders have returned home without severely disrupting our economy."
 mem_eager_traders.4.option:0 "Rejoice!"
 mem_eager_traders.5.name:0 "First [peacefultraders.GetAdj] Traders Arrive"
 mem_eager_traders.5.desc:0 "With a safe passage secured between the §Y[peacefultraders.GetName]§! and the §Y[Root.GetName]§!, the first intrepid merchants have begun exploring their new markets. While the first shipping routes are still being explored, we expect trade to flourish soon."
 mem_eager_traders.5.xenophile:0 "Perfect. Import some §Y[peacefultraders.GetAdj]§! delicacies for me!"
 mem_eager_traders.5.xenophile.tooltip:0 "([Root.GetName]):\n   §YXenophile§! pops gain §G+5%§! Happiness for §Y12§! months\n   §YXenophobe§! pops gain §R-10%§! Happiness for §Y12§! months"
 mem_eager_traders.5.xenophobe:0 "We must ban all imports from the §Y[peacefultraders.GetName]§! to protect our heritage."
 mem_eager_traders.5.xenophobe.tooltip:0 "([Root.GetName]):\n   §YXenophobe§! pops gain §G+5%§! Happiness for §Y12§! months\n   §YXenophile§! pops gain §R-10%§! Happiness for §Y12§! months\n   §YIndividualist§! pops gain §R-10%§! Happiness for §Y12§! months"
 mem_eager_traders.5.individualist:0 "Energy credits, says the proverb, make energy credits."
 mem_eager_traders.5.mercenary:0 "Peaceful traders? Perhaps they can use the services of our mercenaries."
 mem_eager_traders.5.peaceful:0 "War is now both unprofitable and unthinkable."
 mem_eager_traders.6.name:0 "Mercenaries Return from the §Y[peacefultraders.GetName]§!"
 mem_eager_traders.6.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetAdj]§! mercenaries who extended their services to §Y[peacefultraders.GetAdj]§! clients for the past few years have been highly successful. The people of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! are making a name for themselves abroad as capable warriors and shrewd merchants, and many of them have returned with a nice penny from their adventures while hunting pirates and guarding the affluent."
 mem_eager_traders.6.good:0 "They are true professionals."
