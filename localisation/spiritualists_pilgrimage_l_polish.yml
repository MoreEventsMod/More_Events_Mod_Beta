 spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.name:0 "A Denied Pilgrimage"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.desc:0 "A group of our pilgrims was denied to travel to their holy places on [pilgrims_destination.GetName] by your governor. He has denied them access for no known reasons. This is outrageous and you can be sure that if you don´t allow them passage, this behaviour towards our noble people will not be forgotten!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.a:0 "We cannot risk our diplomatic relations. They shall pass!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.b:0 "They shall pass but never be unwatched or unattended."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.c:0 "I´ll let the governor explain his decision first."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.3.name:0 "A Pilgrim´s Joy"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.3.desc:0 "The [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] pilgrims were welcomed with open arms by our colonists and their presence brought out the best in everyone of them leading to increased productivity troughout our colony. The [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] government sends us their regards and thanks you for your wise decision. It seems that our relations have improved to unimagined heights!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.3.a:0 "It is always nice to have guests!" 
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.4.name:0 "Successful Pilgrimage"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.4.desc:0 "The [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] pilgrims caused some wrylooks at first but soon blended into the usual colony life without making any problems. Their government seems grateful for granting them passage and our relations have been improved!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.4.a:0 "We could not have hoped for a better outcome." 
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.5.name:0 "Strange Guests"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.5.desc:0 "Though the [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] pilgrims have been welcomed with open arms by our colonists, there always was a noticeable tension between them. As much as our people likes to have guests sometimes, it is a relief when they are gone..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.5.a:0 "A guest doesn´t stay forever..." 
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.6.name:0 "Barbarians at the Gates"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.6.desc:0 "Those pilgrims might be seeking spiritual guidance by visiting holy places but their religious practices offended many of our colonists which even resulted in some open hostilities towards them. They were gone sooner than anyone could have hoped for but our political relations with their government have worsened since."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.6.a:0 "Hopefully those barbarians won´t return..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.7.name:0 "Ungrateful Guests"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.7.desc:0 "These pilgrims brought nothing but problems since the day they set foot on [pilgrims_destination.GetName]. One incident followed the other and in the end the governor was forced to make them leave the planet. Relations with [pilgrims_origin.GetName] are soured and our colonists are angry for allowing them to come to [pilgrims_destination.GetName] in the first place."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.7.a:0 "Now I understand the governor..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.8.name:0 "Terrorists!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.8.desc:0 "These so called pilgrims are gone now. But not before blowing up our administrative complex. Though we have no evidence, we now believe they were covert operatives acting on behalf of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName]. They do not even try to reject that accusation, this seems to be proof enough."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.8.a:0 "A vile and cowardly act of aggression..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.9.name:0 "Terrorists!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.9.desc:0 "These so called pilgrims are gone now. But not before blowing up our administrative complex. Though we have no evidence, we now believe they were covert operatives acting on behalf of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName]."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.9.a:0 "A vile and cowardly act of aggression..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.10.name:0 "Terrorists in Chains"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.10.desc:0 "Our security forces were able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrive district on [pilgrims_destination.GetName]. These so called pilgrims have been cought red-handed and are imprisoned since waiting for their execution. The [Prev.pilgrims_destination.GetAdj] secret service deems them covert operatives of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName] although no [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] official would ever admid to this foul act."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.10.a:0 "Never trust an alien..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.11.name:0 "Terrorists on the Run"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.11.desc:0 "Our security forces were able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrive district on [pilgrims_destination.GetName]. These so called pilgrims have been cought red-handed but later managed to get away somehow. An insider must have helped them. The [Prev.pilgrims_destination.GetAdj] secret service deems them covert operatives of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName] although no [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] official would ever admid to this foul act."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.11.a:0 "Find those traitors in our ranks!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.12.name:0 "Terrorists and Traitors!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.12.desc:0 "Our security forces weren´t able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrive district on [pilgrims_destination.GetName]. Countless lives have been lost and the district lies in ruins. All traces lead to these so called pilgrims who must in fact be covert agents of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName]. They are unsuprisingly nowhere to be found now, but with all our agents obeserving them they must have had help to pull this one off. Our secret service has started interogating all involved personnel."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.12.a:0 "Heads will roll!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.name:0 "A Conspiracy Unfolding"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.desc:0 "The governor seems to be relieved that you have taken the time to speak with him first before making a rash decision. He informs you about hints of an imminent terrorist attack planned by covert operatives of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName]. He says they have tried to find supporters for their plan but luckily got to the wrong person. It was a loyal officer of the security personnel who they tried to recruit and he managed to play a charade while contacting the governor. Unfortunately, he does not know how many of our men are involved into this conspiracy. This is why he stayed quit about his reasons until now."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.a:0 "Change the security staff and set a trap."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.b:0 "Don´t take a risk. Just deny them access."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.c:0 "He is just paranoid. Let them pass."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.14.name:0 "They Took the Bait"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.14.desc:0 "Thanks to our governor our loyal security forces were able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrive district on [pilgrims_destination.GetName]. These so called pilgrims have been cought red-handed and are imprisoned since waiting for their execution. Unsuprisingly [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] officials deny any involvement."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.14.a:0 "Someone give that man a medal!"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.15.name:0 "Just Paranoia"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.15.desc:0 "Someone must have warned them as no attack has been attempted. Those "pilgrims" just visited their holy places and left without making any problems. Or maybe that governor is just too paranoid for his own good."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.15.a:0 "It could have been worse..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.16.name:0 "The Liar"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.16.desc:0 "What seemed to be a perfect plan was taken apart by an overly zealous security man gunning down one of the pilgrims when he thought him reaching for a weapon. What is even worse is that they turned out to be real pilgrims. The security officer who had informed the governor before was just a meddler and his story a lie."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.16.a:0 "How could we have known?"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.17.name:0 "Safety at a Price"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.17.desc:0 "The [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] officials didn´t like your decision. But on the bright side of things our colony is safe...at least for the time being."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.17.a:0 "Nothing else matters."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.18.name:0 "Paranoid Governor"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.18.desc:0 "The fears of our governor were proofed to be unfounded.

One incident followed the other and in the end the governor was forced to make them leave the planet. Relations with [pilgrims_origin.GetName] are soured and our colonists are angry for allowing them to come to [pilgrims_destination.GetName] in the first place."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.22.a:0 "It could have been much worse...I think..."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.23.name:0 "The Governor´s Warning"
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.23.desc:0 "We should have payed more attention to our governors concerns. Our security personnel was caught totally off guard when the first bombs went up. Countless lives have been lost and the administrative district lies in ruins. All traces lead to these so called pilgrims who must in fact be covert agents of the [pilgrims_origin.GetName]. They are unsuprisingly nowhere to be found now. as it seems someone helped them to escape which buoys up the governors story of an infiltration of our security staff."
 spiritualists_pilgrimage.23.a:0 "I should have trusted his judgement!"
