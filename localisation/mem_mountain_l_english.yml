 mem_mountain_gas_giant_dig_site: "The Ring Station"
 mem_mountain_gas_giant_dig_site_desc: "An ancient ring encircles §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! - a space station of a long-forgotten civilization. \n\nThe technology of the station matches majority of the debris in the system, though it has been spared most of the damage. The source of a forcefield surrounding the nearby moon must also be inside."
 mem_mountain_moon_dig_site: "The Mountain"
 mem_mountain_moon_dig_site_desc: "The only noteworthy feature on this barren world is a giant mountain cose to one of its poles. \n\nAncient landing pads, tunnel entrances and other structures are built into the rock, ready to receive visitors from the distant worlds."

 mem_mountain.1.name: "The Ring Station"
 mem_mountain.1.desc: "The circular station orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§! appears to be relatively intact, and is the likely source of the forcefield surrounding nearby planet. \n\nA proper archaeological expedition is necessary to find more about it."

 mem_mountain.10.name: "The Waystation"
 mem_mountain.10.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! is ready to report [Leader.GetHerHis] first findings regarding the station's purpose. Referred to as §S\"The Waystation\"§! it was operated by a private military contractor with dual purpose - as a military hub protecting the entire system and as a transport hub allowing access to the nearby shielded moon. The exact time frame of station activity can not be determined, but is estimated no less than several hundreds of thousands of years ago. \n\nThe company's employer appears to be some kind of powerful religious organisation that held significant influence in this region of space, but seems to be gone by now. The exact significance of the [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is also unclear."
 mem_mountain.11.name: "The Holy Site"
 mem_mountain.11.desc: "Our expedition into the ring station came across a treasure trove of data that helped shed more light on the station's purpose. Most of it are lists of names and descriptions, accomodation requests and credentials. Millions of members of different species from countless world were visiting the system in the past hoping to gain access to some kind of holy site protected by a powerful shield. \n\nNot everyone in the galaxy was happy with this, however. At some point the worshippers were targeted by a massive military campaign, who besiged their worlds, including the [From.Planet.GetName] station. The end result of the conflict seems to be mutual destruction. The personnel of the station was wiped out and never replaced, but some automatic systems remained functioning even after that and nobody has ever come to finish them off."
 mem_mountain.12.name: "Shield Generator"
 mem_mountain.12.desc: "We have located the source of shield generator inside [From.Planet.GetName]'s station. It is, indeed, powering the forcefield denying the access to the gas giant's moon to anyone who did not receive proper authorization. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! will now seek for a way to gain said authorization and bypass the shield."
 mem_mountain.13.name: "What Do Those Wires Do?"
 mem_mountain.13.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! wasn't able to crack the encription codes that would allow our ships to bypass the shielded surrounding §Y[shielded_moon.GetName]§!. Instead, [Leader.GetSheHe] resorted to simply removing wires from the shield generation in squence until the force fiend ceased to exist. \n\nThe path is now open to us to study the moon's surface and find out what about it was so important."
 mem_mountain.13.a: "Prepare to continue the excavations."
