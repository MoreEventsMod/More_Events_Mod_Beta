 mem_ancient_factory.10.desc:0 "According to a survey by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], the strange rock formations on [From.GetName] are not rock formations at all. They are, in fact, some sort of automated mega-factory, constructed by unknown makers and, judging by its rundown state, abandoned long ago. Despite being far too damaged to be repurposed for our own needs, further study of the complex could be useful for our own factories and automation systems."

 mem_ancient_factory.20.desc:0 "The unusual rock formations on [From.From.GetName] are just that - unusual rock formations. They appear to be some sort of self-contained badlands, too small for our scanners to register as a fully-fledged region."
