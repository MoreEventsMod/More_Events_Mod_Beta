 mem_crawler_anomaly: "Lonely Life Sign"
 mem_crawler_anomaly_desc: "A faint life sign is detected on the otherwise lifeless surface of [This.GetName]."
 
 mem_crawler.1.name: "A Bug in a Box"
 mem_crawler.1.desc: "After following the life sign detected on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!, [Leader.GetName] discovered its source - a large glass box bolted to the asteroid's surface. Inside, [Leader.GetSheHe] discovered a large creature. \n\nIts slim segmented body, about 40 centimeters long, is covered in black chitinous plates and is supported by 138 legs. Its tail ends with a barb, while its head ends with a large mouth adorned by two massive mandibles, alongside with long sensitive hairs and 18 beady eyes of different sizes, half of which are currently looking at [Leader.GetName], silently judging [Leader.GetHerHim]. \n\nSomebody has deliberately placed this container here with enough power and supplies to keep the creature alive for many years. The question is: What are we to do with it now?"
 mem_crawler.1.a: "Put the creature in [Leader.GetName]'s care."
 mem_crawler.1.xenophile: "It's so cute! We should take care of it."
 mem_crawler.1.b: "Take it to [Owner.Capital_Scope.GetName] for dissection."
 mem_crawler.1.c: "Kill it! Kill it with fire!"
 mem_crawler.1.swarm: "Let [Leader.GetName] eat the creature."

 mem_crawler.5.name: "Pet Crawler"
 mem_crawler.5.desc: "While under [crawler_owner.GetName]'s care, the crawler showed itself to be more intelligent than anticipated. \n\nThe creature is able to recognize individuals passing by and form bonds with them, showing excitement when approached by those in charge of feeding it or maintaining its habitat. When not disturbed, it seems to actually be quite friendly and even playful at times."
 
 mem_crawler.6.name: "Crawler is Dead"
 mem_crawler.6.desc: "[crawler_owner.GetName] reports that the Crawler creature in [crawler_owner.GetHerHis] care is dead. \n\nTonight it lay down in its favourite spot under a heating lamp for a last time, coiled up and stopped breathing. No life signs had been detected ever since, and the creature's advanced age is a likely culprit. Since we still have no information regarding the creature's origin and whether there are other crawlers elsewhere, it's quite possible that we have witnessed the complete extinction of the species."
 mem_crawler.6.a: "Rest in peace."
 mem_crawler.6.b: "Declare national Crawler Appreciation Day."
 mem_crawler.6.c: "Now we can safely dissect it."
 mem_crawler.6.d: "This doesn't have to be the end."
 
 mem_crawler.10.desc: "It has come to our attention that one of your citizens, [crawler_owner.GetName], has adopted an alien creature you call §YCrawler§! as a pet. \n\nSaid creature matches the description found in founding sacred texts of the [request_sender.GetName] - that of a powerful demon, Devourer of the Void, the Dark One. It is of utmost importance that you kill the monster before it grows more powerful."
 mem_crawler.10.a: "We aren't killing our pet over some legend."
 mem_crawler.10.a.mat: "This is stupid. You are stupid."

 mem_crawler.11.desc: "Greetings. \n\nOur [request_sender.GetRulerTitle] [request_sender.Ruler.GetName] is a great collector of strange and exotic beings. It has come to our attention that you have found a unique creature you call Crawler. \n\nIf you are willing to sell it, we will pay you £energy §Y1000§!. Do we have a deal?"
 mem_crawler.11.a: "No deal."
 mem_crawler.11.b: "Deal."
 mem_crawler.11.b.tooltip: "The Crawler will be removed from our possession and transferred to [request_sender.Ruler.GetTitle] [request_sender.Ruler.GetName]'s menagerie."

 tech_mem_crawler_physiology: "Crawler Physiology"
 tech_mem_crawler_physiology_desc: "The Crawler creature we picked up from an asteroid has very unusual physiology. But it should still be possible to conduct non-invasive studies without harming the creature and find out what makes it so unique."
 mem_crawler_cloning_possibility: "§HUnlocks Possibility:§! Crawler repopulation."
 mem_crawler_cloning_possibility_desc: "In the future, we might be able to use §YCrawler§! genetic material to restore their population."

Using data we collected while it was still alive, along with post-mortem samples of its cells and tissues, we can use cloning technology to restore its population."

 mem_crawler.13.name: "Crawler Cloning Successful"
 mem_crawler.13.desc: "Using our knowledge of physiology, we were able to revitalize certain cell cultures of the Crawler and trigger a self-fertilized reproduction. The first batch of crawler eggs are hatching now. \n\nIt seems that the species is naturally mutable and with minor adjustments we were able to introduce enough variance into their genetic code to allow for stable reproduction and avoid the genetic meltdown that is typical for closely-related, small populations."
 mem_crawler.13.a: "We can redistribute them as pets across the empire."
 mem_crawler.13.b: "We should establish a natural preserve."
