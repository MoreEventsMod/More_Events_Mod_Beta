mem_engineered_wildlife.1.desc:0 "The native wildlife of [from.GetName] is exceedingly calm in the presence of our researchers. What's more, every species encountered so far is quite aesthetically pleasing to the crew, creating feelings of protectiveness and companionship. While [root.leader.GetName] was originally worried that this may be some pheromone or other alien phenomenon, results show that the animals in question are simply deemed "cute". The pleasing nature of the animals from [from.GetName] is too universal to be a result of natural evolution, and the current leading theory is that this world may have been the target of genetic engineering in the past to create some kind of zoo. Regardless, the friendly nature of the local fauna will be welcome if we choose to colonize the planet."

mem_engineered_wildlife.2.desc:0 "The native wildlife of [from.GetName] is incredibly hostile and dangerous! Several crew members of the [root.GetName] were lost getting samples of the wildlife, and every creature is lethal to organic life in some way or another. Genetic sampling of the species we did capture show clear evidence of genetic tampering. [from.GetName] was most likely a laboratory of the development of alien bio-weapons which eventually got loose. Whether or not the creatures destroyed their creators is unknown. Regardless, the hostile nature of the creatures will create significant barriers for our colonists if we choose to pursue colonization."
