Having access to the collected specimens, our scientists will find whatever weakness these beasts might have - if they have one at all. We will need any edge we can get to protect what is rightfully ours should they ever return."

 # Scourge Story Line Intro
 mem_vazuran_systems.1a.desc:0 "The [root.GetName] reports to have reached the [root.solar_system.GetName] system. The captain describes a gruesome scene. Multiple planets are shattered, and the entire system is littered with debris fields. Even more peculiarly, seemingly organic husks which do not match anything in our database are scattered among these. Further investigation is required."
 mem_vazuran_systems.1.a:0 "Commence an investigation."

 MEM_VAZURAN_EVENT_SYSTEM_SCOURGE_INVESTIGATION_01_DESC:0 "Our scientists in the [root.solar_system.GetName] system have already identified at least two distinct types of dead spaceborn lifeforms amidst the debris fields, though as of yet it is unclear whether they are just different growth stages of one and the same species or two different species altogether. "

 MEM_VAZURAN_EVENT_SYSTEM_SCOURGE_INVESTIGATION_02_DESC:0 "Among the countless debris fields, a number of bigger wrecks remain. They seem to be our best chance of finding out more about what happened here."

 # Finishing Bioship Investigation
 mem_vazuran_systems.101.name:0 "Genetic Engineering?"
 mem_vazuran_systems.101.desc:0 "After studying multiple specimens, it is now clear that the different phenotypes - classified as [root.solar_system.GetName]-X1 and -X2 - are in fact different species, despite sharing several genetic markers and characteristics. There is no genetic variation between individual specimens of each of the two classifications, implying either asexual reproduction or cloning.\n\nThe organisms themselves appear to be the product of genetic engineering, as natural evolution to their current state is highly unlikely. Both X1 and X2 feature exceptionally hardened carapaces similar in durability to military grade armor plates, as well as organs which seemingly acted as mass drivers for organic projectiles, of which our exploration team has found a multitude still buried inside of various wrecks. Judging by the debris fields, they must have been formidable combatants."
 mem_vazuran_systems.101.a:0 "Disconcerting."

 # Finishing Debris Investigation
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.name:0 "Sacrifice And Duty"
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.desc:0 "After spending multiple weeks exploring various wrecks within the vast debris field spanning the [root.solar_system.GetName] system, our exploration team made a major breakthrough. When investigating one of the wrecks, it became clear that they had identified the former fleet's flagship. Furthermore, the ship was found to house a still intact data storage, from which our [root.owner.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] were able to reconstruct the events that took place here roughly four thousand years ago.\n\nTheir empire fought a desperate war against an extragalactic invading force of voidborn lifeforms which consumed all biomass in their way, growing ever stronger the more they consumed.\n\nWith the swarm closing in on this once thriving population center of multiple settled worlds, and only a token force in range to meet the attackers in time, the admiral had to make a hard decision. Knowing he could neither save his people nor defeat his foes, he decided to instead destroy every colonized world in the system in an effort to deny the enemy the biomass they were coming for, before engaging them in battle to give the rest of his people's fleet as much time as possible to close in on the threat.\n\nThe last entry of the admiral's log reads: §SSome may question my right to destroy planets with tens of billions of souls, but those who understand will realize that I had no right to let them live. No sacrifice can be too great when our entire galaxy is at stake. They did their duty and so shall we...§!\n\nOur mere existence seems to prove that his sacrifice was not in vain."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.a:0 "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.b:0 "Extermination process already completed. Our service is not needed here."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.c:0 "How polite of them... They purged themselves so we don't have to."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.d:0 "So much wasted biomass..."

 mem_vazuran_systems.103.name:0 "The Swarm"
 mem_vazuran_systems.103.desc:0 "With the knowledge of what once happened here and the threat of another extragalactic invasion, our [root.owner.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] call for wide-ranging preparations as a contingency in case the swarm should return. For all we know, this invasion force could have merely been a vanguard, despite how dangerous and threatening it clearly was. Given this looming shadow on the horizon, a few of them have already put forward a proposal to carry out in-depth studies on the available samples in order to find possible weaknesses to exploit, should we ever face this foe."
 mem_vazuran_systems.103.a:0 "We should prepare for this scenario."
