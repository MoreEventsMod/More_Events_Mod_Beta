 MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_PROBE_SOFT_SPOT_DESC: "A soft spot on §S[soft_spot_planet.GetName]§! offers an opportunity to use the Viewer and observe other realities."

 mem_sight_unseen_studying_viewer: "Studying the Viewer"
 mem_sight_unseen_studying_viewer_desc: "The reality-piercing contraption will never be used as intended by its creators. That doesn't mean it can't benefit our research."
 mem_sight_unseen_studying_viewer_fatigued: "$mem_sight_unseen_studying_viewer$"
 mem_sight_unseen_studying_viewer_desc: "The reality-piercing contraption can no longer be used to view other worlds. Time to take it apart and see what it's made of."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_4: "Lick it good!"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_4_desc: "The vision from a parallel universe inspired the local specialists to work harder. If tiny slimy creatures can be so industrious, how can our people do anything less?"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_5_good: "Inspired by Slime"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_5_good_desc: "Anyone who heard about the beautiful performance cannot help but long to create something grandiose as well."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_5_bad: "Longing for Slime"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_5_bad_desc: "Once you saw the otherworldly slime dance, how can the pleasures of this universe ever compete?"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_6_good: "Inspiring Violence"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_6_good_desc: "In a different world strange aliens bite their own heads off in a mad bid for dominance. Knowing this, how can anyone resist doing the same? Perhaps to someone else's head."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_6_bad: "Shocked by Violence"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_6_bad_desc: "In a different world strange aliens bite their own heads off. If such madness is possible anywhere, does anything really matter anymore?"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_7: "Intimidated by the Eye"

 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_8_bad: "Distraught at Ruins"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_8_bad_desc: "Everything comes to an end, in this universe and beyond. Is there a point in bothering building anything?"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_9: "Time Enough for Love"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_9_desc: "Biting your mate's tail and rolling down a mountain slope might not be everyone's idea of romance, but there's many ways to show affection."

 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_13: "Otherworldly Carnage"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_13_desc: "The same violence that happened in this world could happen anywhere. You have to be prepared. You have to be afraid. You have to be both."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_14: "Germophobia Epidemic"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_14_desc: "Frightened by the visions of an otherworldly hospital, local population is willing to do anything to avoid visiting one in this world. For some it's healthy living. For others it's locking themselves away from any nasty germs that might be around."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_15: "Happy Fun Balls"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_15_desc: "Inspired by otherworldly spherical creatures, the local population aspires to be as carefree as possible and release all their burdens. Most don't bounce particularly high into the air yet, but they are working at it tirelessly."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_16_good: "Austere Aspirations"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_16_good_desc: "A vision from another world showed local elites what will they become if they don't adopt more austere lifestyle. It's quite frightening."
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_16_bad: "Gluttonous Aspirations"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_16_bad_desc: "A vision from another world showed everyone that there's more to life than mindless consumption. There's mindless and excessive consumption."

 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_19: "Fractal Dreams"
 mem_sight_unseen_modifier_19_desc: "The vision of complex constructs rolling in another world is very inspirational to engineers."

 mem_sight_unseen.1.name: "Derelict Ship"
 mem_sight_unseen.1.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports successfully investigating the wrecked ship attached to §Y[From.GetName]§!. \n\nIt appears to have been a research ship carrying a small crew to an unknown location when it was attacked by pirates. In an attempt to evade them, the ship attached itself to the rock but was too badly damaged in the process to survive. Life support failed, killing the crew almost instantly, and the distress beacon was never activated, leaving the ship undiscovered until now. \n\nThe most noticeable thing about the ship is the cargo - a stack of strange, flat panels. Beneath implausibly smooth surfaces runs sophisticated machinery the purpose of which is unknown. All but one of the panels are fractured beyond repair, but the remaining one is in relatively good shape and can be studied, perhaps even reactivated."
 mem_sight_unseen.1.a: "Bring it back to [Owner.Capital_Scope.GetName] for study."
 mem_sight_unseen.2.name: "Sight Unseen"
 mem_sight_unseen.2.desc: "Our scientists have finished investigating the strange panel recovered from a crashed alien ship. The conclusion is quite interesting. \n\nThe device, henceforth referred to as the §SViewer§!, is capable of somehow piercing the barrier between different alternate realities in specific areas of time-space, revealing how things look in the same coordinates but in another universe. It does not allow travel between the worlds or any kind of communication with them, and it seems it was originally used to study otherworldly life and their strange alien ways. \n\nIt only works in so-called §Ssoft spots§! - small areas where the barrier is weaker than elsewhere - and for a short period of time, so using it might prove inconvenient. \n\nDue to our limited understanding of the technology, our margin for what qualifies as soft spot is much narrower than for the original designers, but our researchers believe they would be able to locate the time and space coordinates of such events so the Viewer can be delivered to the location and activated."
 mem_sight_unseen.2.a: "Start searching for soft spots."
 mem_sight_unseen.2.b: "We should just study the technology."
 mem_sight_unseen.2.c: "Smash the device to pieces."
 mem_sight_unseen.2.c.tooltip: "There's no evidence that aliens on the other end will ever get to us. Neither will we, unfortunately, be able to harm them. Destroying the device would change absolutely nothing about that but would deliver us from having to ever see them."
 mem_sight_unseen.3.name: "Soft Spot Identified"
 mem_sight_unseen.3.desc: "We have identified a soft spot on our colony §S[soft_spot_planet.GetName]§!. The Viewer research team is standing by to deliver the Viewer to the location."
 mem_sight_unseen.3.a: "Make it happen."
 mem_sight_unseen.3.b: "Not this time."
 mem_sight_unseen.3.b.tooltip: "We'll pass on this opportunity to view alien worlds. More chances might present themselves in the future, on a different planet."

 MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_PUBLISH: "Publish the results."
 MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_NO_PUBLISH: "Classify these findings."
 MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD: "§SSight Unseen:§!"

 mem_sight_unseen.4.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ The Cube Factory"
 mem_sight_unseen.4.desc: "On the other side of the Viewer we have found large industrial complex. A conveyor belt is bringing white, semi-translucent cubes from elsewhere, passing by a series of stools, on each of which a small slimy reptilian creature of different colour is seated. As the cubes stop in front of the creatures, each extends an extremely long tongue and vigorously licks the cube, turning the area around the lick the same colour as the creature. \n\nBy the time the cube reaches the end of the line, almost no part of it remains white. Unfortunately, after that it moves out of the viewing area and it's impossible to tell what happens to the cubes next."
 mem_sight_unseen.5.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Slimy Dancing"
 mem_sight_unseen.5.desc: "On the other end of the Viewer, our field of view is somewhat limited as a thick black liquid obscures half the screen. \n\nA tall bipedal figure, also pitch-black, has walked into view. It is wearing nothing a but white expressionless mask and holding some kind of crank-operating device. As it starts turning the crank faster and faster, the liquid starts vibrating, and then it rises up forming ever-changing fractal shapes. The figure seemingly uses crank to control the slime until it abruptly stops, bows to some unseen audience, then liquefies itself, pouring inside the box and leaving only the mask behind."
 mem_sight_unseen.6.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Head Games"
 mem_sight_unseen.6.desc: "On the other end of the Viewer we have found a large open area, with a podium or a stage further away. The viewable area is packed with aliens, each having three heads individually placed on large, thin, bending necks. The only alien on the podium is dressed much more garishly. It's impossible to tell what it is saying but judging by the amplitude of its mouth flapping and limbs flailing, it's quite a pompous speech. \n\nAs the speech comes to an end, the alien grabs a hammer and beats a massive drum placed behind it. At this signal, all the other aliens' heads turn on another trying to bite the other two off their necks. By the time the soft spot dissipated, the whole area was drenched in spurts of blue blood."
 mem_sight_unseen.7.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ The Eye"
 mem_sight_unseen.7.desc: "The entire viewable space on the other end of the Viewer is filled with a giant eye. It looks around, its iris dilating and shrinking. Sometimes it blinks, showing darkly coloured scaly eyelid. \n\nWhat sort of creature could this belong to? We might never know."
 mem_sight_unseen.8.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Little Big Ruin"
 mem_sight_unseen.8.desc: "As far as it's possible to see, the other side of the Viewer is nothing but a ruined megapolis. The buildings themselves are high, rising far into the sky, but its inhabitants seem tiny. Tiny skywalks too narrow even for [Owner.Species.GetAdj] [Owner.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] to walk on, crashed hovercars the size of a toy. Each building having thousands of floors, each just a few centimeters high. \n\nNo signs of life are visible here. The city is crumbling."
 mem_sight_unseen.9.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Downhill"
 mem_sight_unseen.9.desc: "The Viewer had to be installed near the top of a large mountain. The other side seems to be the same mountain slop, although a little more verdant - covered in tall grass and large, vibrant flowers. Above, at the mountain's summit stand two separate groups of creatures with long segmented bodies. \n\nOccasionally one representative of each group steps forward. The two then bite each other's tails, arch their bodies forming almost a perfect wheel and start rolling down the mountain's slope, while the rest of the creatures jump up and down gesticulating wildly. It's impossible to see what happens when they reach bottom but judging by their eagerness it probably does not involve much splattering. Is this perhaps a mating ritual?"
 mem_sight_unseen.10.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Distant Light"
 mem_sight_unseen.10.desc: "At first there didn't seem to be anything on the other end. We even suspected it was broken. After a while however, a lonely light appeared in the distance. It moves around unpredictably, sometimes going out but always returning, brighter than before. The rest of the area in sight seems to be empty."
 mem_sight_unseen.11.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Pyramid Building"
 mem_sight_unseen.11.desc: "Through the Viewers we could observe a group of large, implausibly muscular aliens, all clad in identical red uniforms. The aliens were building a pyramid out of large stone blocks which they handled with remarkable ease. \n\nWhen the pyramid was almost complete, another group of aliens, clad in blue, showed up. After a brief altercation, the red-clad aliens fled, and the blue-clad ones started disassembling the pyramid, carrying the stone blocks away from our field of view. \n\nWhen almost nothing remained in sight, another group of aliens, this time clad in yellow, showed up. Unfortunately, at this moment the soft spot dissipated, leaving us to forever wonder what happened next."
 mem_sight_unseen.12.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Endless Prison"
 mem_sight_unseen.12.desc: "As far as we can see, the other side of the Viewer is an endless empty space basked in dim red light. \n\nThere's no walls, ceiling or floor, only endless rows of cages suspended in nothingness. Inside each cage sits a figure dressed in a hooded robe. No features on them can be discerned. Why are they imprisoned in these cages? We will likely never know."
 mem_sight_unseen.13.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Scene of Carnage"
 mem_sight_unseen.13.desc: "The other end of the Viewer seems to be some kind of residential area. Multiple alien bodies burnt and bisected by what seems to be a laser weapon lie on the ground. Only one alien is still moving, the one holding what can be assumed to be said weapon. \n\nIt simply sits on the ground, rarely changing position. For the entire time the soft spot lasts, nobody else enters the area."
 mem_sight_unseen.14.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Bedtime"
 mem_sight_unseen.14.desc: "The other end of the Viewer seems to be a large, brightly lit hall, filled with seemingly nothing but hospital beds. An alien lies on each of the beds, seemingly unconscious and hooked up to various medical equipment, probes inserted directly into their heads seemingly the most important. \n\nOne alien is conscious. It walks between rows of beds, checking readings on the monitors. Occasionally after doing so it pulls out a long blade from under the coat and plunges it into patient's chest, killing them."
 mem_sight_unseen.15.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Ball World"
 mem_sight_unseen.15.desc: "The other end of Viewer shows no signs of civilization. \n\nWhat the alternate reality seems to have in abundance however is some sort of spherical creatures. Fuzzy balls of different colours, with sizes ranging from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters, are flying and bouncing about, seemingly having no care in the world."
 mem_sight_unseen.16.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Bureaucracy in Action"
 mem_sight_unseen.16.desc: "The other end of the Viewer is a small, dimly-lit room. Most of it is a large pool of nauseating-looking bubbling slime. Submerged in this slime is a massive morbidly obese slug-like creature. \n\nTwo pneumatic tubes are placed within the reach of creature's short stubby arms. Sometimes a piece of paper arrives through one of them. After reading it, the creature sometimes sends it away in another tube, but most of the time it swallows it instead."
 mem_sight_unseen.17.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ The Tree"
 mem_sight_unseen.17.desc: "On the other end of the Viewer is a tree. There doesn't seem to be anything special about it, except for it being so thick it doesn't allow us to see anything else and so tall its crown touches the clouds. \n\nIt's just that big for no apparent reason."
 mem_sight_unseen.18.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Transparent Forest"
 mem_sight_unseen.18.desc: "The other end of the Viewer shows up endless wilderness. There's trees, grass and bushes, but they all seem to be transparent, barely visible unless looked at carefully."
 mem_sight_unseen.18.a: "That's strange, but not that interesting."
 mem_sight_unseen.19.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Shapes"
 mem_sight_unseen.19.desc: "The other end of the Viewer revealed an empty area covered with multiple tiny polyhedrons. Occasionally, said polyhedrons would pile together and assemble into a large object somewhat close to spherical shape and roll out of view. Soon another sphere would arrive from different direction and disintegrate into a pile of polyhedrons, restarting the process."
 mem_sight_unseen.100.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Viewer Destroyed"
 mem_sight_unseen.100.desc: "An unfortunate accident has occurred while delivering the Viewer to §Y[Root.GetName]§!. An engine malfunction caused the delivery shuttle to crash. There were no casualties, but the device itself is broken beyond repair."
 mem_sight_unseen.101.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Project Failed"
 mem_sight_unseen.101.desc: "Due to the unfortunate placement of the soft spot, a Viewer research team has encountered significant difficulties while installing it. \n\nEventually, concerned about working in dangerous terrain and damaging the device, they had to call it off."
 mem_sight_unseen.102.name: "$MEM_SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Viewer Broke Down"
 mem_sight_unseen.102.desc: "Some of the more complex components of the Viewer have given in during the recent activation attempt due to its advanced age. Those parts can't be replaced with our understanding of technology, which means the Viewer is no longer usable."
