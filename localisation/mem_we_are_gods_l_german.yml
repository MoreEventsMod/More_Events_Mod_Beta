 mem_we_are_gods.2.name:0 "We are Gods?"
 mem_we_are_gods.2.desc:0 "It seems the natives of this planet have come to believe we are... gods. This left us in a very awkward spot when one of our research teams were discovered and the natives fell on their knees instead of attacking them. Religions based on the worship of us are on a steady rise throughout their society, including some that refer to us as those that will "ascend them to a higher plane of existence". It does make it easier to abduct natives for further study though, given that they basically offer themselves."
 mem_we_are_gods.2.a:0 "Intriguing."
 mem_we_are_gods.2.b:0 "Gods... You could almost like these primitives."
 mem_we_are_gods.2.c:0 "At least they are on the right path... SOMEWHAT."
