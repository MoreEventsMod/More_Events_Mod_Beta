 mem_we_are_gods.2.name:0 "We are gods?"
 mem_we_are_gods.2.desc:0 "It seems the natives of this planet have come to believe we are... gods. This left us in a very awkward spot when one of our research teams were discovered and the natives fell on their knees instead of attacking the team. Religions surrounding us are on a steady rise throughout their society, including some that refer to us as those that will "ascend them to a higher plane of existence". It does make it easier to abduct natives for further study though, given they basically offer themselves."
 mem_we_are_gods.2.a:0 "Intriguing."
 mem_we_are_gods.2.b:0 "Gods... You could almost like these primitives."
 mem_we_are_gods.2.c:0 "At least they are on the right path… SOMEWHAT."
