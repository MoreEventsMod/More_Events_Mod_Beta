 mem_dead_star_category:0 "Missing Star"
 mem_dead_star_category_desc:0 "According to our charts, the §Y[Root.GetName]§! system should contain a very bright star. This could be attributed to a simple calculation error... but that star is one of the more prominent stars in our homeworld's sky. We should investigate this further."
 mem_dead_star.4.name:0 "Calculation Error"
 mem_dead_star.4.desc:0 "It seems that there was some error in the calculations, and the real star's location is somewhere else."
 mem_dead_star.4.a:0 "Noted. We should move on."
 mem_dead_star.6.name:0 "Dead Star"
 mem_dead_star.6.desc:0 "It seems that the navigator was right. The star is here... or rather its remnants are. It seems that it had collapsed under its own weight a long time ago, creating §Y[From.GetName]§!. An astrophysicist on the board claims that the light of the event just hasn't reached §Y[Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]§! yet. But according to his calculations, it should in a few years."
 mem_dead_star.6.a:0 "Nothing will be the same"
 mem_dead_star.6.b:0 "A once in a millenium chance!"
 mem_dead_star.6.c:0 "Everything ends."
 mem_dead_star.1.name:0 "Star Goes Dark"
 mem_dead_star.1.desc:0 "As it was predicted by the scientist many years ago, tonight one of the stars vanished from §Y[Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]§!'s sky. It flared up in the sky for a few seconds, and then it was gone. In spite of the media coverage, most of the planet's population missed the moment, some not realizing that the star was gone for days. Thankfully, our scientists were more vigilant than our citizens, and were able to obtain a lot of interesting data from the event."
 mem_dead_star.1.a:0 "Good job!"
 mem_dead_star.2.name:0 "Supernova"
 mem_dead_star.2.desc:0 "The night has come! As it was predicted by the scientist many years ago, tonight one of the stars in §Y[Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]§!'s sky went supernova! Scientists and citizens alike turned their eyes and recording devices to the sky so they would not miss even a fraction of the spectacle. The images of the star were also beamed to the citizens on the colony worlds, so that they too could participate in the event. This event will surely leave its mark on our minds, textbooks and research!"
 mem_dead_star.2.a:0 "We were so lucky to witness this!"
 mem_dead_star.3.name:0 "Death Of A Star"
 mem_dead_star.3.desc:0 "The night has come... As it was predicted by the scientist many years ago, tonight one of the stars on §Y[Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]§!'s sky died. Fearful citizens stood vigil the whole night, holding lights and looking up to the sky to enjoy the view of the star while they still could. The star itself was gone in a moment... Like all of us will be. Our scientists seem happy that they have obtained some interesting data, but everyone else received a harsh reminder that everything and everyone must die someday."
 mem_dead_star.3.a:0 "Memento mori."
 mem_supernova_celebration:0 "Exciting Supernova"
 mem_supernova_mourning:0 "Mourning Lost Star"
 mem_supernova_celebration_desc:0 "The inhabitants of this planet are excited to have witnessed a supernova."
 mem_supernova_mourning_desc:0 "The inhabitants of this planet are mourning the death of a star in their sky."
