 #Messenger from the Shroudwalkers arrives
 mem_astral_tales.3.name:0 "A Mysterious Guest"
 mem_astral_tales.3.desc:0 "When entering [ruler.GetHisHer] office, [ruler.GetRulerTitle] [ruler.GetName] immediately noticed that something was off. The light is unsettlingly dim, much more so than it ever used to be before. Dark shadows creep from the corners of the room eating away at what little is left visible.\n\nFrom these shadows a hooded figure emerged seemingly willing itself into existence. With it completing its form some of the light has returned as well.\n\nThe unbidden guest silently beckons the [ruler.GetRulerTitle] to come closer..."
 mem_astral_tales.3.a:0 "Approach the figure"
 mem_astral_tales.3.b:0 "Alert security! Intruder alarm!"

 mem_astral_tales.4.a:0 "How did you get in here?"
 mem_astral_tales.4.a.response:0 "§HAs if to answer the [ruler.GetRulerTitle]'s question, the figure briefly emits a faint but noticeable aura of psionic power.§!"
 mem_astral_tales.4.b:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_astral_tales.4.b.response:0 "§HAn image forms in the mind of the [ruler.GetRulerTitle] representing the sigil of the [mem_shroudwalker_country.GetName].§!"
 mem_astral_tales.4.c:0 "Why are you here?"
 mem_astral_tales.4.c.response:0 "§HThe hooded guest reveals a small cube-like metal object and carefully places it upon the ground.\n\nThe figure slowly takes a few steps back melting into the shadows again until it has vanished completely."
 mem_astral_tales.4.d:0 "What is this?"

 mem_astral_tales.6.desc_01:0 "§HThe hologram slightly tilts his head.§!\n\nI assume a binary designation would barely suffice as a name to your kind. These Shroudwalkers came to call me 'traveler' since my sphere was ejected out of their Shroud Tunnel and now they believe me to be some divine herald.\n\n§HThe traveler gives a barely recognizable wink.§!\n\nBut who am I to correct them? A mere hologram, a scientist, a doctor even. But no theologist, no. In truth, their ignorance has proven to be quite beneficial to my ends and allowed me to be where I was ought to be. But do not fret, for I am not here to inquire you to state the nature of your medical emergency. Indeed, you seem quite well... for now. Besides, my area of expertise lies elsewhere entirely."
 mem_astral_tales.6.desc_02:0 "§HThe orila slightly tilts his head.§!\n\nI beg your pardon. That name does have a familiar sound to it, though it is not mine.\n\nMy initial designation will be of little use to you either. These Shroudwalkers came to call me 'traveler' since my sphere was ejected out of their Shroud Tunnel and now they believe me to be some divine herald.\n\n§HThe traveler gives a barely recognizable wink.§!\n\nBut who am I to correct them?

 mem_astral_tales.6.desc_03:0 "§HRealizing the possible implications, he shakes his head in a fit of embarrassment.§!\n\nNot at all, I can assure you of that. It's just that, when you've had the same conversation a thousand times over and already know all the possible outcomes, you'll try to spice it up by improvising here and there. It appears my words were chosen poorly though. Have my apologies."
 mem_astral_tales.6.a:0 "For now? Is that a threat?"
 mem_astral_tales.6.b:0 "What is your area of expertise then?"
 mem_astral_tales.6.c:0 "What do you mean by 'a thousand times'?"

 #one answer fitting both questions
 mem_astral_tales.7.desc_01:0 "§HWith a brief gesture of his hand, multiple displays start to flicker around the Traveler. [ruler.GetName] can make out bits and pieces of historical events, wars between alien civilizations [ruler.GetHeShe] has never heard of before, planetary catastrophes, galaxy-wide calamities, death and destruction, followed by the rebirth of new civilizations. Cycles of creation and destruction...§!\n\nWell, you see, I am a blend of what you might consider a historian, an archaeologist, and last but not least - a physicist. Contrary to the usual variety, however, I do not study the past - I study the present of wherever I visit to accumulate knowledge, a perk of having unlimited lifetime.\n\nNext is where my expertise in physics comes into play. Am I correct to assume that you are at least aware of the theory of multiverse - parallel realities existing next to ours? Indeed, in my case it is less of a theory and more of a practical matter. There are also other planes of existence which form an overarching connection between these different realities. The shroud, you are aware of, and the astral plane - home to some nasty energy beings, you probably wouldn't ever want to meet - are but two of those.\n\nI traverse these planes in order to move between parallel universes. In fact I do not just stumble around without a clear purpose however. Maybe you have heard of a saying 'all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players'? If that is the case, then whom are they playing for? Who is the one watching?\n\nThis is what I asked myself a long time ago, before I received a revelation from my benefactors. In each and every reality there is at least one civilization that is special, in that the sole focus of a Higher Being lies on that civilization alone.\n\nMy mission given by my benefactors is to seek out such civilizations and contact them as I did you."
 mem_astral_tales.7.desc_02:0 "§HThe traveler nods...§!\n\nIndeed, but not only that. They also influence your entire civilization in various ways. For example, have you ever made a decision, that may have seemed out of place or illogical at the time, but in hindsight lead to the best possible outcome in that situation? Surely you have.\n\nThis is the extent of how far their influence can reach. They are not bound to our perception of time and space and some of them even have the complete knowledge of the past, the present and the future and use it to further their goals, for better or for worse."
 mem_astral_tales.7.desc_03:0 "My benefactors wish to relay a message to your Higher Being through you. But be aware that knowledge about the content of that message may forever change your perception of reality. Others before you were broken by the weight of its implications.\n\nIt is your decision, whether or not to receive the message."
 mem_astral_tales.7.a:0 "A higher power is watching us?"
 mem_astral_tales.7.b:0 "So, why are you contacting us?"
 mem_astral_tales.7.c:0 "We have to know!"
 mem_astral_tales.7.d:0 "Some things are better left unknown."

 #Last Window
 mem_astral_tales.8.desc_01:0 "§HAs asked, the traveler starts to present the message he was tasked to carry...§!\n\nHello, this is Malthus from the More Events Mod speaking.\n\nFirst of all let me excuse this intrusion, but there wasn't any other way to actually reach you outside of Stellaris. Messages on the steam page or on other social media are likely to only ever be seen by a few. You can be sure however, that this event here will stay the only time of me directly addressing you throughout the content of our mod.\n\nWork on MEM began shortly after the release of Stellaris in 2016 and was first released on steam in May of that year starting out with a few additional anomalies and mechanically basic events. Because of VonMourn's retreat from the project due of time concerns I took over the publishing in the workshop since 18th of July 2016 - over seven years ago now - and together with the remaining team members we expanded and maintained it throughout the many updates the game has received ever since.\n\nWe always wanted to make our content as immersive as possible, but always had one big problem. That being art assets - be it 2D or 3D art. None of us is an artist and finding anyone willing to join up with us has been a mainly unsuccessful endeavour over the years.\nThat being said, there is one alternative left, if we want to achieve the goals we've set for ourselves. §YCommissions.§! Luckily we came into contact with a very capable artist who does exactly that. From way back, when we still had the PayPal donation link, we got around 20$ which together with Caligula's and my personal funds went into the creation of paragon and species portraits used for the mod. An example you can see above this text, the others are shown in the pictures section of our workshop page on steam. We've spent a few hundred dollars in total for this and I regret nothing. We have to make a cut at some point however, as our funds as anybody's are limited.\n\nYet, there are still a lot of things we would love to add to the mod and continue cooperation with the artist. For this we will be reliant on your support.\nIf you have enjoyed this mod, the many uncounted hours of work we have put into this project have been worth it. If you can afford it and deem this project worthy of your support please check out our mod page and donate for the cause of further improving it. Every single coin matters and I am thankful for each and everyone who decides to back us.\n\nI also want to take a moment to give my heartfelt thanks to everyone who already did so in the past. You guys are my heroes.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through all of this.\n\n§HWith his task finished the Traveler gives his farewell and dematerializes together with his cube...§!"
 mem_astral_tales.8.desc_02:0 "§HThe traveler accepts [ruler.GetName]'s decline without a hint of disappointment.§!\n\nIn this case I wish you the best and will take my leave now. By the way, I have left some of my data on your storage device to be used at your leisure.\n\n§HFor a moment the traveler looks past [ruler.GetName] and says:§!\n\nWhat was will be. We will meet again in another time and place.\n\n§HShortly thereafter he and his cube dematerialize and the [ruler.GetRulerTitle] is once again left alone in [ruler.GetHisHer] office."
 mem_astral_tales.8.a:0 "It's all just a game?!"
 mem_astral_tales.8.b:0 "Farewell, traveler."
