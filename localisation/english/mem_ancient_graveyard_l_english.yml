mem_ancient_graveyard_category:0 "An Odd Pattern"
mem_ancient_graveyard_category_desc:0 "Our sensors are picking up strange readings from a large valley on the planet's surface. It seems to be filled with small metallic spikes arranged in a regular grid pattern. However, they are too small to properly discern from orbit. We should examine it more closely."

mem_ancient_graveyard.1.name:0 "A Final Resting Place for Many"
mem_ancient_graveyard.1.desc:0 "Our survey team discovered almost a billion upward-faced primitive pulse rifles dotting the valley, each muzzle topped by what appears to be a visored helmet of alien design. This appears to be the resting place of countless soldiers fallen in a long forgotten war. Although well-preserved in almost vacuum, the primitive rifle design is of little interest to our scientists. Deep scans into the ground underneath also revealed nothing of value. It seems we'll never know what really happened here, all those aeons ago."

mem_ancient_graveyard.2.name:0 "A False Positive"
mem_ancient_graveyard.2.desc:0 "It appears the strange pattern was nothing but an echo caused by an improperly calibrated sensor. Our survey team found nothing down there, and a second sensor sweep did not repeat the prior results."

mem_ancient_graveyard.1.default:0 "Let them rest in peace."
mem_ancient_graveyard.1.xenophobe:0 "More dead xenos, huh?"

mem_ancient_graveyard.2.dissapointing:0 "Disappointing."
