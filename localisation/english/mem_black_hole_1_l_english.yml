 mem_black_hole_1_category_desc:0 "The black hole §Y[Root.GetName]§! appears to have a small object orbiting just outside the event horizon. Upon closer examination, it appears to be a small, ancient wormhole generator built by an unknown civilization, possibly as a way of opening a path into the event horizon and investigating what lies beyond. Our scientists would like to examine the technology closer."
 MEM_BLACK_HOLE_1_PROJECT:0 "The Path Beyond"
 MEM_BLACK_HOLE_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A scientist should try to activate the ancient wormhole generator..."
 mem_black_hole_1.1.name:0 "Successful Investigation"
 mem_black_hole_1.1.desc:0 "Upon closer examination, the wormhole generator has clearly been damaged by the passage of time. However, lead scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! believes that it can be repaired."
 mem_black_hole_1.1.a:0 "Do it."
 mem_black_hole_1.1.b:0 "It's far too dangerous."
 mem_black_hole_1.2.name:0 "Success?"
 mem_black_hole_1.2.desc:0 "After repairing the wormhole generator, the science ship §Y[Root.GetName]§! was sucked beyond the event horizon and is now missing in action. We can only hope that the wormhole is robust enough for them to return."
 mem_black_hole_1.2.a:0 "We wait with bated breath..."
 mem_black_hole_1.3.name:0 "What Lies Beyond"
 mem_black_hole_1.3.desc:0 "The science ship has returned, and its crew has been transformed. They refuse to discuss the "unspeakable" things that lie beyond the event horizon, but we must trust that those insights will benefit our empire."
 mem_black_hole_1.3.a:0 "We hope they are all right."
 mem_black_hole_1.4.name:0 "An Old Relic"
 mem_black_hole_1.4.desc:0 "Upon closer examination, the wormhole generator has clearly been damaged by the passage of time. Given its proximity to the event horizon, further investigation would be deeply unsafe and unlikely to bear fruit."
 mem_black_hole_1.4.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 mem_black_hole_1.5.name:0 "A Tragic Mistake!"
 mem_black_hole_1.5.desc:0 "While investigating the wormhole generator, lead scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! accidentally switched it on, unaware that it was damaged. As a result, the science ship §Y[Root.GetName]§! was sucked through the wormhole into the black hole, never to be seen again."
 mem_black_hole_1.5.a:0 "Terrible."
