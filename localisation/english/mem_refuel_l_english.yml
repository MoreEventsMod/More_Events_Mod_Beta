mem_refuel_category:0 "Fuel Leak"
mem_refuel_category_desc:0 "Scans are detecting a cloud of unidentified substance spreading through the gas giant's upper atmosphere. Its chemical composition, radioactive signature and high energy density suggest advanced starship fuel..."

mem_refuel.1.name:0 "Abandoned Refuelling Station"
mem_refuel.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] was able to trace the fuel cloud around [From.GetName] to its source - an old space station of unknown origin. \n\n[Leader.GetName] estimates the station to be at least 400 years old. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] believe[Leader.GetSXX] it was safely preserved for most of that time, but was recently struck by an asteroid, which destabilised its orbit and breached its main storage tank. It is clear that this station will not last long, and neither will its precious content."
mem_refuel.1.a:0 "Syphon the fuel into [Root.GetName]."
mem_refuel.1.a.tooltip:0 "§RPumping fuel from unknown source might be dangerous...§!"
mem_refuel.1.b:0 "Track the fuel cloud for future recovery."
mem_refuel.1.c:0 "Find a way to save the station for future study."
mem_refuel.1.d:0 "Take this opportunity to study the station."
mem_refuel.1.e:0 "Keep away. It's not worth the risk."

mem_refuel.2.name:0 "No Such Thing As Free Fuel"
mem_refuel.2.desc:0 "We are receiving a distress call from [Root.GetName]. It appears that the fuel it obtained on [FROMFROM.GetName] destabilised its systems, causing a catastrophic engine failure that ultimately led to a very large explosion. \n\nIt looks like using a fuel from an unknown source without proper testing might not have been the right call."

mem_refuel.20.name:0 "Failure"
mem_refuel.20.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] detected a space station leaking fuel in a decaying orbit of [FROMFROM.GetName], but despite [Leader.GetHisHer] crew's best effort, [Leader.GetSheHe] [Leader.GetWasWere] not able to dock with it for further investigation, and [Leader.GetWasWere] forced to disengage as the station disappeared into denser parts of the gas giant's atmosphere."
mem_refuel.20.a:0 "Unfortunate."

mem_refuel.30.name:0 "Failure"
mem_refuel.30.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] detected a space station leaking fuel in a decaying orbit of [FROMFROM.GetName]. Trying to dock to it for further investigation, however, has proven to be disastrous, as both [Root.GetName] and the station were destroyed in a resulting collision."

mem_refuel_modifier:0 "Alien Fuel"
