 mem_native_problem.2.name:0 "Native Problem"
 mem_native_problem.2.desc:0 "Several colonists have been found dead on the outskirts of our main settlement on the newly colonized planet, §Y[Root.GetName]§!. The cause of death is multiple gunshots fired from a long range. \n\nOur authorities have not been able to identify the perpetrator so far, but they are confident that none of the colonists were in the area where shots originated from. The response team sent to the area was not able to find any clues either. \n\nWith investigations inconclusive, many colonists are afraid to leave their homes and speculation is running wild - could it be that [Root.GetName] was not as uninhabited as we thought?"
 mem_native_problem.2.a:0 "Alarming."
 mem_native_problem.2.purifiers:0 "If there are natives, we just need to kill them all."

 mem_native_problem.3.name:0 "Further Investigation Into Shooting"
 mem_native_problem.3.desc:0 "Authorities on §Y[Root.GetName]§! report that, over the last few months, several more colonists have lost their lives to mysterious shootings. \n\nHowever, progress has also been made into finding the perpetrators. Apparently, an extensive limestone cavern network runs deep underground, with numerous difficult-to-find entrances scattered in the wilderness. Whoever is responsible for the shootings is hiding somewhere deep inside, but it would take us considerable time to clear the whole area out."
 mem_native_problem.3.a:0 "Just collapse the entire system."
 mem_native_problem.3.a.tooltip:0 "The caverns will be filled with thermobaric explosives in gaseous form and detonated, burying whoever is responsible for the shooting forever..."
 mem_native_problem.3.b:0 "Start preparing to invade those caverns."
 mem_native_problem.3.b.tooltip:0 "We will start preparing a solution to clear the caverns out. Whoever is responsible for shootings might be taken alive, but there are no guarantees..."
 mem_native_problem.3.c:0 "Begin preparations to invade the caverns and capture the inhabitants."
 mem_native_problem.3.c.tooltip:0 "A non-lethal solution will take §Ssignificantly longer§!, but the shooters will be captured alive."

 mem_native_problem.4.name:0 "The End of the Shooter"
 mem_native_problem.4.desc:0 "The mysterious shooter responsible for multiple deaths on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally been cornered deep inside limestone cavern networks by the authorities and killed after putting up fierce resistance. \n\nSurpisingly, the perpetrator turned out to be [Owner.GetSpeciesName], but not a colonist who moved to the planet officially as part of the colonisation project. The tattered flight suit [the_guy.GetSheHe] was wearing indicates that this was [the_guy.GetName] - captain of a small private vessel that vanished without a trace about ten years ago. \n\nIt is likely [the_guy.GetSheHe] crashed the ship and somehow survived on the planet's surface ever since. It's not entirely clear what caused [the_guy.GetHerHim] to attack the colonists, but prolonged wilderness exposure likely had a negative impact on [the_guy.GetHerHis] sanity."
 mem_native_problem.4.a:0 "A tragic story."

 mem_native_problem.5.name:0 "Shooter Arrested"
 mem_native_problem.5.desc:0 "The mysterious shooter responsible for multiple deaths on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally been cornered deep inside limestone cavern networks by the authorities. After a brief skirmish, [the_guy.GetSheHe] was subdued and detained. \n\nSurprisingly, the perpetrator turned out to be [Owner.GetSpeciesName], but not a colonist who moved to the planet officially as part of the colonisation project. The tattered flight suit [the_guy.GetSheHe] was wearing indicates that this was §Y[the_guy.GetName]§! - captain of a small private vessel that vanished without a trace about ten years ago. \n\nAfter medics managed to return [the_guy.GetHerHim] to [the_guy.GetHerHis] senses, [the_guy.GetSheHe] was able to shed light on [the_guy.GetHerHis] story. A sole survivor of [the_guy.GetHerHis] ship's crash on the planet's surface, [the_guy.GetSheHe] has fought for survival ever since, but prolonged isolation, combined with the diet of less than safe to consume local plants, caused [the_guy.GetHerHim] to develop a variety of cognitive problems. Upon spotting the first colonists, [the_guy.GetSheHe] was only able to see them as monsters and attacked."
 mem_native_problem.5.a:0 "Execute [the_guy.GetHerHim] for treason."
 mem_native_problem.5.b:0 "A trial will determine if [the_guy.GetSheHe] is responsible for [the_guy.GetHerHis] actions."
 mem_native_problem.5.c:0 "[the_guy.GetSheHeCap] survived here for 10 years? We could use this skill."
 mem_native_problem.5.c.tooltip:0 "§Y[the_guy.GetName]§! will become a §Sgeneral§! in our empire."

 mem_native_problem_fear:0 "Gripped by fear"
 mem_native_problem_fear_desc:0 "The populace of this planet lives in fear of a mysterious shooter. Anyone could be the next target!"

 mem_leader_trait_native_problem_general:0 "Survivor"
 mem_leader_trait_native_problem_general_desc:0 "This leader spent over a decade alone on a distant planet and knows a thing or two about survival."
