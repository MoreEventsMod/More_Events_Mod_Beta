 mem_through_the_fog_dig_site: "Through the Fog"
 mem_through_the_fog_dig_site_desc: "The surface of this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is covered by decaying ruins of abandoned cities hidden by a thick toxic fog. Elevated electrical activity in the atmosphere makes it difficult to study them from orbit, but shielding equipment should allow us to explore the surface safely."
 
 mem_through_the_fog.1.name: "Zomarr Ruins"
 mem_through_the_fog.1.desc: "Archaeological research on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! confirms that the ruins on the planet belong to an extinct species that called themselves the §SZomarr§!.\n\nUnlike most, they did not seem to be interested in space travel and had never discovered the hyperlane network. However, they nonetheless developed impressive technologies while almost never leaving the vicinity of their homeworld. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! names §Snanotechnologies§! as their primary area of expertise. \n\nIt seems they were wiped out when another massive body, perhaps an asteroid or a comet, collided with their [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], rendering it uninhabitable. Curiously, very few bodies have been found outside of the designated burial grounds - far fewer than would be expected in the case of a massive disaster like this."
 mem_through_the_fog.2.name: "Portent of Doom"
 mem_through_the_fog.2.desc: "It appears the Zomarr had obsessively made and maintained low-tech hard copies of their news publications, fearing tampering and disruption. Some of those storages are still intact, and §Y[Leader.GetName]§! was able to reconstruct parts of the events leading to the downfall of their civilization. \n\nA large number of reports concern the \"§SPortent of Doom§!\" - a massive comet on a collision course with [From.Planet.GetName]. Later on, the Zomarr leadership revealed the existence of a secret project prepared for an extinction-level event, but the exact nature of the event is unclear for now. The leading nanotechnology experts were apparently called in to contribute to it."
 
 mem_through_the_fog.3.name: "The Cloudminder Project"
 mem_through_the_fog.3.desc: "Following information recovered from the archives, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! was able to locate one of the facilities where researchers aimed to save the Zomarr from extinction. Codenamed \"§SProject Cloudminder§!\", it appears to be related to nanite swarms in some way, but it is unclear what exactly the goal was. The project was completed shortly before the impact, and most of it was abandoned and not saved for posterity, seeing as there was no reason to backup anything in light of impending doom."
 
 mem_through_the_fog.4.name: "The Zomarr Live!"
 mem_through_the_fog.4.desc: "After an extensive studies, archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have confirmed what was long suspected. The Zomarr have survived the impact event that destroyed their planet, but not in a form we would recognize. \n\nAfter an extensive sensor calibration, it became apparent that the air is now saturated with nanites, each containing a piece of a Zomarr mind. In anticipation of the impact, Zomarr authorities have distributed samples of a new type of nano-machines for citizens to inject themselves with. While a few refused, most had their brains scanned and bodies disassembled into nanite swarms, each capable of maintaining a Zomarr mind that was consumed. This way they have survived the devastation of their world. \n\nEver since we've stepped on the planet, they have been trying to communicate, although due to the power requirements, most remain dormant and only a few are active at any given time. Most of the key personnel had to stay in a corporeal form to ensure the successful transformation, so we are unlikely to find sufficient data to replicate this process. However, the very possibility of such an existence is fascinating."
 mem_through_the_fog.4.a: "Use EMP generators to destroy the nanites."
