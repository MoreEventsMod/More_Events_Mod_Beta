 # Anomaly Category 
 mem_nanobot_room_category:0 "Unique Mining Outpost"
 mem_nanobot_room_category_desc:0 "Scans have indicated an interesting find on the surface of [Root.GetName]. It appears to be an abandoned mining station, but our science ship's sensors have picked up fluctuating energy signals originating from within the station. \n\nIt would appear that the facility is still active."
 
 # Anomaly Success
 mem_nanobot_room.1.name:0 "Nanobot Mining"
 mem_nanobot_room.1.desc:0 "Despite encountering initial difficulties when landing on the surface, the scientific expedition team led by [Root.GetLeaderName] managed to enter the station safely. Following their suit sensors, the team began to make the arduous journey into the depths of the facility, towards where the unstable energy signals were originating from. What they found was quite extraordinary. \n\nThe irregular energy signals were produced by swarms of nanobots, which, despite their age and a lack of maintenance, seem to have not forgotten their purpose. The team watched in awe as the nanobots, for the lack of better terms, 'devoured' seemingly useless rocks and stones, 'digested' the contents, 'excreted' the useless material into a disposal box and 'regurgitated' the valuable minerals into a retrieval collection, which doesn't seem to have been emptied for some time."
 mem_nanobot_room.1.a:0 "Their creators won't mind us taking their minerals."
 mem_nanobot_room.1.mat:0 "Repair the nanobots."
 
 # Anomaly Failure
 mem_nanobot_room.10.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_nanobot_room.10.desc:0 "The energy signals disappeared as quickly as they had appeared. After a few hours of probing and investigating, [Root.GetLeaderName] gave up [Leader.GetHisHer] search. Whatever caused the energy signals will never be found."
 mem_nanobot_room.10.a:0 "Let's go."
 
 # Anomaly Epic Failure
 mem_nanobot_room.20.name:0 "Critical Failure"
 mem_nanobot_room.20.desc:0 "As the team landed on the surface of the planet, [Root.GetLeaderName] accidentally triggered an old defense protocol. The ground shook, and to the team's curiosity and horror, the energy signals started to be navigate up the depths of the facility, directly towards the science team. The team attempted to leave the planet, but to no avail. \n\nThe energy signals turned out to be a horde of aggressive nanobots, which have quickly devoured [Root.GetLeaderName], [Leader.GetHisHer] crew, and even the entire science ship. Upon consuming the crew, the nanobots scurried back down into the mining facility. It seems that we will never know what the nanobots were originally doing."
 mem_nanobot_room.20.a:0 "Damn."
