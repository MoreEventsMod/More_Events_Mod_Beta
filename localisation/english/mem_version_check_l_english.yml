 # Warning message
 mem_version_check.2.name:0 "Notification"
 mem_version_check.2.desc:0 "This message appears because More Events Mod has been either activated in a running game, or has been updated after this game has been started.\n\nIn a case of this mod being activated in an ongoing game, it will not cause any problems, but some features will only be available in a newly started game.\n\nIn a case of this game being started with MEM already active, this means there was an update. It might not necessarily cause problems, but as always, updates have a small chance to break the old game saves. If you encounter problems, please confirm that these issues also appear in a newly started game before reporting them as bugs. The issues may very well result from the version incompatibilities between the old game save and a new mod version.\n\nThis warning message won't appear again in this play-through. We hope you enjoy our mod!"
