 # Arrival in Orbit
 mem_czar_alexei.1.name:0 "Rift Nexus"
 mem_czar_alexei.1.desc:0 "We have arrived in orbit of a habitable world. There are no apparent signs of civilization, but the surface is teeming with life.\nBesides the rift through which we arrived here, there are numerous others in different phases of activity. Some of them are open, allowing for objects to pass through, while others appear to be inert.\nOur sensors are picking up a signal - possibly from a distress beacon - repeatedly broadcasting its location on the surface of the planet's northern hemisphere.\n\nHow do we proceed?"
 mem_czar_alexei.1.a:0 "Scan and catalog the other rifts for later investigation."
 mem_czar_alexei.1.b:0 "Head for the broadcasted location immediately."

 mem_czar_alexei.2.name:0 "Mysterious Foes"
 mem_czar_alexei.2.desc:0 "Preliminary results of our scans indicate these rifts to connect this place with different parallel realities, each separate from one another. This observation sparked a lively discussion among our crew as no such place has ever been discovered within our galaxy. However, debates regarding this topic were cut short, when another object - apparently a rift-traversing vessel not unlike our own - emerged from a rift and immediately opened fire upon us. Quite unlike our own - this rift sphere appears to be heavily armed. The fired shots critically damaged our sublight engines and severed our tether.\n\nOur pilot, while performing a controlled ditch, does his best to bring us as close as possible to the beacon. We hope the earlier located signal can lead us to some kind of help."

According to our sensors, the attackers just passed over our crash site and left the immediate area.\nA superficial assessment of the sustained damage leaves little to no doubt that the needed repairs will be extensive if at all possible. With our tether gone, letting ourselves get reeled back, is out of the question.\n\nWe are close enough to the signal beacon to make our way on foot in the hope of finding help or usable materials there. Alternatively, we could take a detour to a nearby crash site which our scanners located earlier. Lastly, we could focus our efforts on repairing our sphere with what we have at hand."
 mem_czar_alexei.3.desc.b:0 "Our descent into the atmosphere was suddenly interrupted by weapon fire damaging our sublight engines and severing our tether. The attacker - apparently a rift sphere similar to our own, but unmistakenly more heavily armed - must have shadowed us for the duration of our stay, waiting for the moment to strike.\n\n$mem_czar_alexei.3.desc.a$"

As it stands, though, neither my former title nor empire have any significance to you, given that this is a quite different parallel reality from what I can tell so far."

Their society appears to be dominated by an archaic martial philosophy and the act of hunting and defeating strong opponents seems to be held in high regard within it. They regard other species as beneath them.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that they have made this rift nexus their hunting ground. With so many parallel realities connected to one another, it is bound to lure in a diversity of interesting "prey"."
 mem_czar_alexei.15.b:0 "How did you end up on that planet?"
 mem_czar_alexei.15.b.response:0 "In short a coup.\n\nSome of my closest subordinates conspired against myself. Trust and friendship blinded me from seeing their greed and lust for power slowly corrupting them until it was too late. When their true colors were revealed, a choice had to be made: Stay and fight or go into exile.\n\nI chose the latter, as I did not create an empire to see it consumed by the flames of civil war and the suffering that would follow.\n\nMy intention was to reach one of the other galaxies connected to the rift nexus. The hunters took offense to this, however, and "invited" me for a longer stay. Since then I had a series of skirmishes with their hunting parties."

Some of the findings are now integrated into my armor. A miniature laser cannon in my bracer, a personal shield generator and not to forget this sword, which is more than just a simple piece of metal as you may have noticed.\n\nThese things were quite useful, but the most important augmentation, I was able to attain from my archaeological projects, were nanites from a secluded star cluster located near our galactic rim. Immunity to poison, an increased healing factor and anti-aging properties - these little machines are beyond useful.\n\nThough, the hunting parties that came after me, grew progressively larger.
