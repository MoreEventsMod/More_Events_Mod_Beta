 #Events
 mem_descended.1.name:0 "Gravitational Anomaly"
 mem_descended.1.desc:0 "When entering the §Y[from.GetName] system§!, our crew is greeted by a peculiar sight. A rift in spacetime stretches across the system, limiting the accuracy of our sensors. What was previously assumed to be a sole star with a few planets is in fact a binary system with a much smaller and barely visible brown dwarf accompanying the primary star, its orbiting planets without exception veiled in ominous layers of clouds.\n\nThis is not where the peculiarities end, however, as according to our observations the center of gravity is not [from.GetName] but a planet, which is indeed not only habitable but also inhabited, by a seemingly primitive civilization. Everything here at least in extension revolves around it.\n\nHow all this is possible is already a topic for hot debate between our experts. One thing they all agree on already, though, is that its origin is beyond a doubt artificial."
 mem_descended.2.desc:0 "A fleet detected near the rift is hailing us. Its composition does not look like any other design we have encountered so far. They have begun closing in on our position, possibly to cut off an escape."

 mem_descended.5.desc:0 "We are received a signal originating from the primitive world shortly after destroying the unknown attackers. It is unclear how the primitives could even know about our presence, let alone communicate with us, but this is exactly what is taking place. To make this even more mysterious, the message uses our language, inviting us to an audience with their ruler."

 mem_descended.6.name:0 "The Audience"
 mem_descended.6.desc:0 "§LArriving on the surface, our delegation is met by a small group of [mem_descended_native_species.GetName] natives. One of them steps forward, making himself known to be the leader of this humble welcoming committee, while the others curiously eye the new arrivals. After a brief greeting, our delegation is led to a - compared to their otherwise rudimentary architecture - rather opulent and out of place palace.\n\nWithin the entrance hall, the guide begins a speech:§!\n\nYou will soon be in the presence of the Golden One, the Many-Colored, God-Emperor Neochadamus the Immortal, First of his name, Ruler of the Toralonian Empire, Lord Ascendant of the Galaxy, Sovereign of the Unseen Skies, King of the Ancients and the Forerunners, Lord of the Stars and Protector of the Realm...\n\n§LDuring a brief pause, hope for an end of this plethora of titles blooms, but it is short-lived. The [mem_descended_native_species.GetName], after taking a small breath of air mercilessly subverts this expectation by continuing his apparently well trained, but dryly delivered recitation of his ruler's titles and supposed accomplishments for another agonizing hour and a half...\n\nHaving finally finished the ordeal and visibly exhausted himself, he addresses the delegation again:§!\n\nYou may now enter the inner chamber to meet our lord in person."
 mem_descended.6.a:0 "Let us move on."
 mem_descended.7.desc:0 "§LBefore the delegation stands a sole native, though one of a unique golden color, awaiting their arrival.§!\n\nAh...what a delivery. So monotone, so free of expression, just marvellous. In all honesty though, those guys couldn't even fake a smile if their life depended on it. But they are loyal and hard workers, you have to give them that.\n\nWhen I first found them, they lived in shabby caves, teetering on the brink of extinction on a dying world circling a waning star. Just look at them now, living on a paradise world under a warm sun... in slightly less shabby hovels. Yeah, I know, it's still a work in progress. Some changes come easier for them than others. But I digress...\n\n§LHe takes a step closer to his guests and continues with a subtle gesture pointing towards himself.§!\n\nAs you have heard, I am Neochadamus... Neo-chada-mus, care to remember that. The last one to mispronounce my name now graces the surface of Soothing Shade - this planet's moon, in case you are unaware... Though technically everything in this system is this planet's moon, even the sun... But details... details...\n\nFor those I call friends, Chada will be enough. And I do have a feeling that we will be fast friends indeed, you and I."

 mem_descended.8.b.response:0 "Originally this galaxy, believe it or not. More recently though I came from an extradimensional space, same as my "friends" you so valiantly defeated.\n\nBy the way, you have my gratitude for that. It was a strain on my energy reserves to keep them at bay."
 mem_descended.8.c:0 "Did you create this system?"
 mem_descended.8.c.response:0 "Oh no, but you could say I did some extensive renovation as well as a few side projects here and there."
 mem_descended.8.d:0 "Why did the Colorless besiege this place?"
 mem_descended.8.d.response:0 "Well... they are sore losers, I'd say. Even in a higher plane it is "eat or be eaten", and so I treated their place as an all-you-can-eat buffet and funneled their energy towards a more deserving host - myself.\n\nOh, come on, don't judge me for that, you have seen that they treat your kind just the same. So, serves them right, I say."
 mem_descended.8.e:0 "What do you want from us?"

 mem_descended.9.desc_01:0 "To put it bluntly, I need your energy. Don't look at me like that... I'm not a savage like these other guys...\n\nI intend to reclaim and then hold my position on the upper plane, but in order to reascend, I will need an empire's worth of... let's call it spiritual energy for a lack of a better word. This does not require any psionically gifted individuals, as the energy is set free when entire populations are united by a common goal and work as one. As such this would even work with inorganic or synthetic lifeforms.\n\nIn return I offer you my expertise as well as my continued support once my ascension has been successful. Good deeds should be rewarded, shouldn't they?\n\nWhat do you say? There is no downside to this deal. My subjects will join your empire as well. You can only win.\n\n§HAs he awaits your answer, his eyes begin to glow ever so slightly brighter than they had before...§!"
 mem_descended.9.desc_02:0 "So, what do you say? Will you support me in my endeavor?\n\n§HYou see the glow of his eyes beginning to intensify again...§!"

 mem_descended.9.b:0 "Ye... No we do not."
 mem_descended.10.desc:0 "I see. There is no point in continuing this conversation then. You may leave, but be aware that you have squandered the opportunity of a millennium for yourself as well as your people."

Ah, no just kidding.\n\n§LWith a smirk on his face he raises a hand and snaps a finger...\n\nThe Colorless ships are hurled back into the rift like a child may throw a toy. After them, the rift closes and the battle is over.§!\n\nNow that this is dealt with, I believe there is only one thing left to do here.\n\nBut you and your people have served me well. So it would be rude to just leave you behind with nothing in return. I'll leave behind a little present, so you won't feel lonely without me around.\n\n§LWith that said, he begins to glow with ever increasing intensity. The light soon drowns out all else, and just as it is becoming unbearable, it suddenly stops. Is it done? Were Neochadamus stood before, there is now... He is still there!?§!\n\n"Well, it looks like his plan went as intended. Hello my dear [root.GetRulerTitle], nice to make your acquaintance. Don't look so surprised, he did tell you, didn't he? He left me behind to support you in your struggles. I am his aspect, an avatar, if you so like. Maybe not as powerful as he himself, but I'll get the job done, I assure you.""

 mem_descended.301.q:0 "Can you do a §Yrobot§!?"
 mem_descended.301.r:0 "How about something more regal?"
 mem_descended.301.r.response:0 "Is this appearance more to your liking my dear [root.GetRulerTitle]? If so, I think I'll stay like this for a while."
 mem_descended.301.z:0 "Can you make yourself look like one of us?"
 mem_descended.302.desc:0 "Well, that is a long story... To make it short, they are the descendants of my subjects from before my first ascension.\n\nFor a modest contribution to my cause, I surely could convince some of them to enter your service..."
 mem_descended.302.a:0 "Where do they come from? We haven't heard of them before."
 mem_descended.302.a.response:0 "The galaxy is more than just the few systems connected by the hyperlanes. In the past we moved freely between the stars... And some still do. It appears there are quite a few enclaves of monastic orders hidden outside of the network, who were waiting for my return - not that it was ever planned, but well... Here we are."
 mem_descended.302.b:0 "We would like to hire one of their fleets."
 mem_descended.302.b.response:0 "As you wish. I'll send out a calling... You may expect them within half a cycle."
 mem_descended.303.desc:0 "Oh, why wouldn't you? I'll humor your curiosity. So what is it you'd like to know?"
 mem_descended.303.a:0 "Is your energy form your true appearance?"
 mem_descended.303.a.response:0 "You could say that it is my natural state, but I am able to take any form I so choose."
 mem_descended.304.desc:0 "They are a group of ascended beings, though not as skilled in interpersonal relationships as yours truly, in case you haven't noticed yet.\n\nThey do use technology and rely on it to travel between dimensions and do all kinds of horrible things to lesser species. Let's not get too deep into this topic, however. It just ruins my mood."
 mem_descended.304.a:0 "Can you give us any advice on how to fight them?"
 mem_descended.304.a.response:0 "As you may have observed, their ships entirely rely on energy based technology, both in offense as well as in defense. A fatal flaw, if you ask me. But in their arrogance it doesn't seem to occur to them.\n\nFor you however this is a weakness to exploit: Their weapons are weak against §Yshields§!. So focus your defense on these. And when it comes to theirs... Your primitive §Ymissiles§! and §Ytorpedos§! will make short work of their hulls as they completely bypass shields. Just saturate the space around them and it won't matter, if they have point defense.\n\nWith your fleet prepared accordingly you will be able to punch way above your weight, at least against them."
 mem_descended.304.b:0 "Is there anything else you can offer us?"
 mem_descended.304.b.response:0 "For a modest contribution to my power I would be able to temporarily improve your fleet's shields and give it an edge in combat.\n\nAside from that, there may still be followers of mine out there in the galaxy, who could be convinced to help us in our predicament."
 mem_descended.304.c.response:0 "For a modest contribution to my power I would be able to temporarily improve your fleet's shields and give it an edge in combat.\n\nAside from that, I could offer you to call some of my followers to aid in your fight."
 mem_descended.304.d:0 "Please improve our shields."
 mem_descended.304.d.response:0 "As you wish, you shall have my blessing."
