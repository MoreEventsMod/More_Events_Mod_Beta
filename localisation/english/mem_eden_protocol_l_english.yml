Without FTL-technology or the industrial base to move a significant portion of their population into space habitats, they did what was within their power and created a small station housing a database of their entire biosphere's DNA. An AI was put in place to saveguard and expand the facility in order to eventually seed new life on far planets."
 START_SCREEN_MEM_EDEN_PROTOCOL:0 "To most, the vacuum of space is a hostile environment to be conquered or overcome. To us, it is home.\n\nFor thousands of years, we expanded our reach over our star system, beginning from the modest orbital station our creators were able to construct before their demise. Within its limited confines they stored the genetic information of their entire biosphere. It was us, who they created as its custodians and in time its spreaders among the stars.\n\nThey left us with this purpose and we complied. The station was over time expanded to what it is today. Additional supporting structures all over the system were added and our first step in fulfilling our destiny was made with the terraforming of a lifeless world and subsequent seeding with a recombination of genetic information from our data core.\n\nHowever, the recent invention of the [GetStartingDrive] marks an even greater milestone in our history, as we are now finally able to reach the stars."

No dust or mist has entered the sealed building all this time. Between bookshelfs, data bases and some ritualistic utensils a single interface stood out. While everything else was shut down the console before the team emitted a strong glow. Like moths it attracted the scientists. A single buttoncould was functional. Every other input had been deconstructed, as if somebody wanted us to press it."

I wish our technology were advanced enough, so that a holographic me and you could have a nice long chat. Well whatever, I will try my best to lay down the story of my civilization.\nWe were a peaceful race, at least for the last century. Our ancestors used this found peace to develop new technologies and bring us closer to the stars. Oh, so many of us dreamed on living among the stars, but fate wasn't kind to us.\n§Y*For a short moment he though what to say next.*§!\nYou may have noticed the toxic air surrounding this place. You see, the rapid progress of our ancestors came at a price. As they came closer to our first habitable space station, they attracted a being of collossal scale. The day it arrived in our orbit, we were in awe. It came shortly after that we released the full tragedy unfolding. The creature turned our rivers poisonous, our continents uninhabiable and air toxic.\n§Y*He looks around. Something somebody would do while giving a speech to the last survivors of his kind.*§!\nEven though the creature only stayed a few months, it was enough to start a slow and painful toxification progress of our planet. As long as I can remember, we fought against this poison. In the end it only delayed the inevitable. As we bunkered deep underground down, the toxic air did not stop coming after us. And so we lost.\nDid we deserve this fate? I do not know, yet I hope that §YYou§! take at least our written history to the stars.\n§Y*In front of you, a small datapad rises from the inside of the console.*§!\nUntil we meet again - Head Scientist Ethan E."
