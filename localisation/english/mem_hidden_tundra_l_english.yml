 mem_hidden_tundra_category_desc:0 "Chief scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has gotten some interesting readings from the planet §Y[From.GetName]§!. A closer investigation seems warranted."

 mem_hidden_tundra.1.name:0 "It's a Habitable Planet!"
 mem_hidden_tundra.1.desc:0 "It turns out that §Y[From.GetName]§! is not barren, as our first scans have shown, but actually is a tundra world. It still appears to be a pretty bleak planet though. It has an almost featureless surface and next to no plant life. However, we should still be able to colonize with the help of light local terraforming efforts. We should also establish a research outpost to learn how life on such a planet is even possible."

 mem_hidden_tundra.2.name:0 "A Barren Uninteresting Rock in Space"
 mem_hidden_tundra.2.desc:0 "Contrary to the first assumptions of §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, §Y[From.GetName]§! is just a dead, boring rock in space. We should focus our research efforts elsewhere."
