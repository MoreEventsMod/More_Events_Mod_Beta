 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.desc:0 "The recovered crystal shards show remarkable similarities to the smaller specimen we have encountered before, yet there is a striking difference in their behaviour. While previously-encountered crystals acted aggressively, their actions had always been limited to their own territory. Also, the enormous size of this larger specimen leads our scientists to the conclusion that it has to be a new species.\n\nThe material which makes up almost the entirety of its mass possesses astonishing self-repairing abilities, a property that may be applied to our ships' armor plates given more time and research. A new research option has been added to the project pool."

Instead, they can be found in varying concentrations across the planet, slowly extracting minerals from the soil throughout their growing process. It is hard to tell at this point how this will affect the planet's ecosystem.\n\nThere are multiple possible courses of action to be taken. The colonists can try to root out the crystal infestation, periodically harvest them, or study their growth."

It appears to be the oldest specimen to ever have been encountered by any of our vessels. Why it came here remains a mystery, but it was assumed to have neared the end of its life cycle by the time we encountered it.\n\nBesides this there was only a marginal gain of understanding regarding its natural regenerative ability which will nonetheless aid our future research efforts in this field."

The concentration of toxic particles associated to the amoeba's corpse are falling steadily.\n\nApparent reason for this decline are the mutated plants, which are already reclaiming formerly dead regions fueled by the absorption of these particles. We expect their rapid growth to subside once the atmosphere is clear of contamination.\n\nIf this trend continues [This.GetName] will end up more habitable than it was before this ordeal."
