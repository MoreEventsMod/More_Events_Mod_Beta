# First Event
mem_under_blanket.1.name: "Under the Blanket"
 mem_under_blanket.1.desc: "Early reports speak of mysterious activity deep below the surface of [Root.GetName]. Analysis of the scanned signatures alludes to the existence of a formerly unknown species. Our scientists are more than eager to attempt a ground operation to find and study them."
 mem_under_blanket.1.materialist: "We should study them right away. This is an exciting discovery."
 mem_under_blanket.1.xenomilit: "These xenos could be dangerous. Take all the necessary precautions."
 mem_under_blanket.1.others: "Send them in but take all the necessary safety precautions."
 mem_under_blanket.1.deny: "They have more important work to do."
 
 # Event Selection
mem_under_blanket.2.name: "Leadership Crisis"
 mem_under_blanket.2.desc: "After a brief scientific consortium, all resources and funds have been assigned and the expedition is almost ready to begin. However, they could not yet decide who should lead the expedition. They ask for your opinion.\n\nIt is worth noting that during the complete duration of the expedition, the selected scientist won't be able to perform any other tasks.\n\nThe candidates for the expedition leadership are:"
 mem_under_blanket.2.expertleader: "[mem_under_blanket_expert_leader.GetName], recognized as an expert in the field."

 mem_under_blanket.2.randomleader.tooltip: "[mem_under_blanket_random_leader.GetName] will be completely focused on this task and will therefore be unable to perform any other actions for us."

 # Ground Team
 mem_under_blanket.3.name: "Ground Team"
 mem_under_blanket.3.desc: "Our expedition had passed the first layers of sedimentary rock and reported back. Signs of artificial erosion around the walls indicate the presence of lifeforms. Estimations approximate that thousands of this species' individuals were nearby or had passed through this very location not too long ago. Shortly after their first report the team's proximity sensors warned them of approaching heat signatures. Forced to stop, they heard rustling in the rock approaching ever closer to them. Should these aliens be aggressive, our small expedition could potentially be overrun within moments.\n\nContact is imminent."
 mem_under_blanket.3.retreat.xenomilit: "To all units, retreat immediately."
 mem_under_blanket.3.retreat.others: "It's too dangerous to proceed. Retreat."
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.materialist: "What are their intentions? Did we disturb them?"
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.xenomilit: "Get the soldiers ready. Protect the scientists."
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.others: "Exercise caution but proceed with the investigation."
 
 # Retreat - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.10.name: "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.10.desc: "After receiving the order, the squad rushed to escape. Loud, guttural groans of the unknown xenos were reverberating around the cave's walls. Out of the shadows, dozens of beasts charged at our team, and three of our soldiers were instantly ripped to shreds. Striking from gaps in the walls, multiple large claws violently eviscerated six other expedition members. Only [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] and one soldier managed to make it to the exit. Feeling that it was his sense of duty to protect [Root.GetName], the remaining soldier sacrificed himself with an emergency nuclear warhead, allowing [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] to escape and leave the horror behind."
 mem_under_blanket.10.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.10.others: "We will remember them."

 # Retreat - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.11.name: "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.11.desc: "While falling back, the group had realized that a well camouflaged entity was following them in the shadows. Our soldiers opened fire when it suddenly closed in, successfully incapacitating the unknown thread. This isolated attack away from the horde we detected earlier provided our team with a prime opportunity to extract the specimen, which our scientists deemed to merely be a juvenile of its kind. Given the danger it alone posed, confronting a horde of mature specimen was out of the question.\n\nThe exit to the tunnels has since been sealed."
 mem_under_blanket.11.xenomilit: "The dissection of this xeno will educate us."
 mem_under_blanket.11.others: "Observation of this xeno will reveal its species' secrets."

 # Retreat - Third Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.12.name: "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.12.desc: "Exercising caution, the expedition crew has made their way towards the tunnel's exit.\nThe monitors had been eerily silent. For now the nature of the alien lifeform remains a mystery, but before leaving the cave network our scientists had time to launch a drone, giving us an opportunity to continue the exploration from a save distance.\n\n[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] plans to keep monitoring the situation remotely."
 mem_under_blanket.12.xenomilit: "Bomb the site."
 mem_under_blanket.12.others: "This new species hasn't revealed all its secrets yet."
 
 # First Contact - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.20.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.20.desc: "[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] had ordered the escort to hold back. With hesitation, a small figure approached our group. The scientist extended a hand to initiate peaceful contact unpon which the creature cautiously sniffled before rubbing its head against it. After a brief moment, a guttural moaning noise was emmited by the creature and then suddenly, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] was rapidly swarmed by hundreds of these small furry specimen. These strange, innocent animals seem to enjoy cuddling a lot."
 mem_under_blanket.20.xenomilit: "They can be used for slave labor."
 mem_under_blanket.20.others: "Our people will likely adopt them."

 # First Contact - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.21.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.21.desc: "Our expedition has been investigating a large chamber. Our temperature and humidity measuring instruments revealed a tropical ecosystem containing vegetation and water, allowing more advanced forms of life to flourish. Tens of thousands of small organic creatures seem to live here peacefully. Preliminary observations suggest that the active creatures are, in fact, just watchmen, guarding an even bigger population of hibernating ones.\n\n[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] and the scientific consortium plan to continue their studies remotely to prevent any contamination and avoid disturbing the creatures."
 mem_under_blanket.21.xenophobe: "Bomb the site, we can't take risks."
 mem_under_blanket.21.others: "A fascinating self-sufficient species."
 
 # First Contact - Third Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.22.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.22.desc: "The wildlife we have discovered is far more violent and dangerous than we had initially expected. While trying to communicate our peacefull intentions, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] was lacerated by the claws of one of the beasts. We had to abort the mission and secure the zone. Thanks to the heavily armed military personnel accompanying the expedition, we managed to contain the rush of beasts. While the backup team had been securing the exit, the main expedition made their way back out of the cavern in a fighting retreat closely followed by hordes of growling and slashing beasts.\n\nAfter their successful evacuation, the remaining expedition leaders decided to seal the entry to the cave system."
 mem_under_blanket.22.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.22.others: "A regrettable loss."

 # First Contact - Fourth Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.23.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.23.desc: "Even after taking all imaginable precautions while approaching the wildlife, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] still ended up surrounded. One of the creatures approached the scientist, gave a single brutal, guttural groan before it shredded [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHimHer] into tatters. Observing thie the escort opened fire, but were trampled by thousands of these creatures.\n\nDuring the last communication with the backup team a strong earthquake was reported shortly before the signal was lost. We have to assume their position has been overrun.\n\nNot long after these incidents, reports about above ground sightings of these creatures started flooding in."
 mem_under_blanket.23.desc.delayed: "What was initially seen as regular earthquakes in an area of [Root.GetName] by local seismic warning systems, has turned into a military emergency.\n\nMultiple settlements reported being attacked by previously unknown creatures before contact was lost. When aerial reached these locations they were already completely overrun. Orbital strikes were ordered to contain a further spread of these creatures.\n\nAnalysis of raw data shows that this invasion originated from an unexplored and unsecured underground cavity. The scientific community has strongly criticized our failure to study the phenomenon while we had the chance."
 mem_under_blanket.23.desc.captured: "Study of the captured adolescent creature had started to reveal its secrets. As innocent as it appeared for its size, about half the size of a [root.owner.GetName], its three large, sharp claws fixed on its neck should not be underestimated. Closely monitored by multiple security guards, the alien showed remarkable agility while moving around and testing the security measures of its cell. Its bulky chest hid not one but twelve small hearts. The entire body was protected by its armored outer shell made of hardened tissue comparable to chitin. While not sedated it showed ferocious resistance to any approach. In terms of diet, it appeared to be purely carnivorous in nature, with a remarkable peference for brainmatter. Our specialists could not uncover any sign of sapience. It seemed to be mainly driven by its survival instincts.\n\nThey had also detected low frequency signals that the creature has been emitting to the ground. Unfortunately this observation was deemed inconsequential at the time.\n\nShortly after, highly alarming seismic data started to come in from all around [Root.GetName], triggering the planetary-wide security protocols, with military forces being deployed to all regions. Reports have come in of large swarms of creatures coming from below ground rushing our forces. Thankfully, our military was well prepared and entrenched, and managed to contain the assaults thanks to the courage of our forces. Most casualties sustained where reported from the area around the cave. Unfortunately, many lives were lost in that region and streams of creatures continue to pour out of it periodicly. This forced our troops to fall back farther from the cave entrace and create an extended exclusion zone to contain the threat."
 mem_under_blanket.23.tooltip: "A pop is killed and §RDangerous Wildlife§! now roams over [Root.GetName]."
 mem_under_blanket.23.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.23.others: "This is a tragedy."
 
 # Under the Blanket - Follow up to Retreat #3
 mem_under_blanket.120.name: "Under the Blanket"
 mem_under_blanket.120.desc: "Our probe has finished its route in the underground cave network before being destroyed by the inhabitants. Further analysis of the collected data has provided us with better understanding of the unknown organisms. These creature appear to continue to grow for their entire lifetime, which is both good and bad news. On one hand once a creatue has grown old - and big enough - to be a serious threat to our colony on [Root.GetName] it simply cannot leave the cave system though its narrow exits anymore. On the other hand however, if they manage to reach the surface and establish a population above ground they could become an unmanagable threat if not dealt with quickly.\n\nThe science department, headed by [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName], however, notes that this species appears to require a gas, only found in the caverns, for longterm survival. In addition they have observed them to feed off rare crystals which are present down there in plentyful supply. Our leadership on [Root.GetName] insists on the importance of mining these rare crystals and decimating the alien menace." 
 mem_under_blanket.120.noxenophile: "Strategic resources should be prioritised."
 mem_under_blanket.120.all: "Do not harm them. Send an escort."
 
 # Genocide
 mem_under_blanket.121.name: "Genocide"
 mem_under_blanket.121.desc: "Once the decision was made, the only thing left to do was commencing the operation. In order to not endanger anything above ground our weapon of choice was a simple unreactive, heavier-than-air gas to flood the entire cave system with and suffocate anything within. Once the deed was done our team investigated the bigger chambers until they reached the last known location of their probe - the alien nest.\n\nSuffocated creatures of varying sizes littered the ground. We have caused the extinction of an entire species.n\n\On the bright side, the rare crystals are ready for the taking." 
 mem_under_blanket.121.a: "Clean the chamber and start the excavation."
 mem_under_blanket.121.b: "At what cost?"
 
 # Heritage - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.122.name: "Heritage"
 mem_under_blanket.122.desc: "Determined to make contact with the life form, the team has carefully made their way to the last known location of our drone. Thundering sounds of bursting gas deep below accompanied them as they went deeper into the cave. Soon enough, visual contact with the creatures was made. Surprisingly they did not seem bothered by our presence. The team made several quick observations: the creatures adorned with heavy rock armor, seemed to have a geophagial diet. The result of this diet, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is quite sure, are the rare crystals which they excrete through a large dilation in the lower section of their hulking bodies."
 mem_under_blanket.122.a: "Fascinating."

 # Heritage - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.123.name: "Heritage"
 mem_under_blanket.123.desc: "[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] has been reported missing. After an investigation, a secret stash of casebooks and a custom-built analysis machine have been found in [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHisHer] laboratory. Spectrograph sketches, multiple erasures and various annotations all over the pages acknowledge an incredible find by the inexperienced scientist: The gas found in the cave network seems to be communicating. Highly volatile and mutagenic, its fumes are able to shape themselves into different chemical signatures.\n\nH-I, Co-N-V-Er-Ge, U-S, He-Re, F-O-U-Nd, La-W-S, As, O-Ne.\n\nFurther analysis of the chemical atomic weight values has revealed the message to contain the coordinates for a location within the cave network. A rescue team has been dispatched immediately.n\nAt the location, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] was found naked, unconscious and levitating in the middle of a large crystalline chamber while clutching a spherical obsidian stone. As the team approached closer, a dense multicolor veil of vapor emerged from [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHisHer] body. Jerked back to consciousness, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] suddenly proclaimed: 'I know everything, laws converge as one.' Then, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetSheHe] fell on the ground. The rescue team brought [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHimHer] back to the surface where [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetSheHe] made a quick recovery."
 mem_under_blanket.123.a: "Fascinating."
