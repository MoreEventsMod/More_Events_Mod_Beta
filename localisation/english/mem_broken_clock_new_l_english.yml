 mem_broken_clock.1003.desc.lith: "The time goes by and life withers and dies. But stone is eternal. Stone endures while all the rest fades to dust and ashes.\n\nNow look at your own forms, born to do nothing but decay and perish, rotting and crumbling as you watch. Is it not a blasphemy to creation itself to exist in a such a pitiful state?\n\nLook at your pathetic existence and say farewell to it, for the Primacy of Stone has returned to cleanse the universe of your imperfection."
