 mem_artifact.52.desc:0 "Our away team entered the station, the place is desolate and appears to have been long since abandoned. The structure is made up of small enclosed rooms with corridors of varying heights, which is hampering progress.\n\nWe eventually managed to restore power to some minor systems in what we suspect to be a control room and have unearthed several pieces of information about this solar system and the research conducted here. The most important being a central object in the system and three research facilities in the nearby vicinity containing similiar artifacts.\n\nAcquiring these three "ciphers" as they are called should be our priority if we plan to further study the main object. On the other hand some of our scientists suggested to not waste time with such a paper chase and try our luck with the main object immediately."

But yet again there is discord amongst their ranks.\n\nWhile some of them are eager to start at a moments notice others still remain reluctant, reminding that we are dealing with unknown and ancient technology.\n\nMaybe we should try to acquire these "ciphers" first before blindly rushing into whatever dark secrets this relic might hold."

 mem_artifact.64.name:0 "The Relic"
 mem_artifact.64.desc:0 "Our Science team has finished their study of the artifact. From all the data available to us we now assume it is not native to our known universe. The technology is different from anything we have seen before. The material it is made of is in a state of constant flux since we powered it up.\n\nOur scientists came to the conclusion that this object is some form of explosive device. According to their estimations, it could obliterate an entire star cluster or even more. If they are correct, we may have found the most dangerous weapon our galaxy has ever seen."
 mem_artifact.64.a:0 "Good to know, it is in our hands."

 mem_artifact.65.name:0 "The Lament"
 mem_artifact.65.desc:0 "When the activation sequence drew near completion a sudden flash brought everything to a halt.

According to our sensors their energy level is rising rapidly. We must have activated some kind of defensive mechanism."
