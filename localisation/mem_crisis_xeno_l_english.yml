  ### Events

  # Dangerous Wildlife Attack Settlement
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.name:0 "Predatory Wildlife Outbreak"
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.desc:0 "We've been aware of the dangerous wildlife that exists on [Root.GetName], but since our colonization of the planet our security teams and settlement defenses have been effective at maintaining the safety of our civilians.\n\nThat has changed. In the night, several hours ago, a previously-unknown species of apex predator attacked one of our settlements and quickly overwhelmed our defenses and security detachments. Over the course of an hour, these predators wrought havoc throughout the settlement, only ending their spree when our military stepped in. Casualty reports indicate a massive loss-of-life, with nearly sixty civilian deaths and hundreds wounded.\n\nAlthough the military essentially obliterated all hostile predatory elements, we were able to retrieve a single dead specimen from those that did not somehow flee. Cursory investigation indicated the presence of a strange, fungal-like growth on the creature. Clean-up teams reported seeing the fungus twisting and writhing while they extracted the specimen."
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.a:0 "Send it all to the lab."
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.a.tooltip:0 "The specimen and the strange fungus are given to researchers to be studied.\n\n"
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.b:0 "Take a sample of the fungus."
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.b.tooltip:0 "A sample of the fungus is given to researchers to be studied.\n\n"
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.c:0 "We can't risk anything. Atomize the specimen."
  mem_crisis_xeno.2.c.tooltip:0 "The specimen and the strange fungus are atomized, leaving nothing behind.\n\n"

  # Revealed Genetic Manipulation (SPECIAL PROJECT)
  mem_crisis_xeno.3.name:0 "Specimen Analysis Completed"
  mem_crisis_xeno.3.desc:0 "Our researchers have completed their thorough analysis of the specimen we recovered from [mem_crisis_xeno_planet.GetName]. It appears that the creature itself is a cousin species to an animal commonly found in the planet's wilderness. This animal is hardly aggressive towards the [Root.GetSpeciesName], only attacking when provoked. Contrarily, the specimen we recovered was extremely hostile and overtly aggressive, attacking anything on site besides its own kind. The specimen exhibits a number of visible mutations, including additional limbs, various holes excreting a black mucus-like substance, and a whip-like exoskeletal tail with an exceptionally sharp organic blade at the end, among other such features. \n\nDissection of the specimen revealed a systemic fungal infection throughout the creature's entire nervous system. Samples revealed that the specimen's mutations were made up of 86% fungal material, prompting researchers to believe the fungus to be the cause of the mutations and even the erratic behavior. Researchers believe further investigation into the nature of fungus is warranted and may be the key to understanding its origin."
  mem_crisis_xeno.3.a:0 "We need answers. Our analysis shall continue."
