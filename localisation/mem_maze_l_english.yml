 mem_maze.2.name:0 "The Lost Structure"
#  mem_maze.2.desc.m:0 "The demolition of a large mountain range on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has opened the way to a valley we were unaware of before. Inside it, landscape engineers have found an alien structure of some sort. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.j:0 "When clearing the dense overgrowth on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, landscape engineers made an astounding discovery. Previously camouflaged by plant overgrowth, an alien structure revealed itself. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated by abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
#  mem_maze.2.desc.q:0 "A minor retraction in a quicksand basin on §Y[Root.GetName]§! during a stabilization operation has led to an astounding discovery. An alien structure of a sort that was previously buried in sand resurfaced. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
#  mem_maze.2.desc.g:0 "The vaporization of a glacier on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has led to an astounding discovery. An alien structure that was previously entirely encased in ice revealed itself. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
#  mem_maze.2.desc.k:0 "Clearing out the kelp coverage on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has produced something astounding. What was thought to be a small island covered in kelp has turned out to hide a large and mysterious alien structure. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.machine: "While removing dense vegetation on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we discovered an alien structure. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. \n\nAny attempts at explore it further failed, however, as any unit we sent in, no matter how shielded, was instantly disabled as it approached."
 mem_maze.2.desc.hive: "While removing dense vegetation on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we discovered an alien structure. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. \n\nAny drone we tried to send to take a closer look, however, was cut off from us and quickly withered, preventing us from further exploring the site."
 mem_maze.2.gest: "How tantalazingly odd..."
 
 mem_maze.4.name:0 "Alien Structure"
 mem_maze.4.desc:0 "A mysterious alien structure on §Y[Root.GetName]§! is attracting the attention of scientists and laymen spectators alike. Speculation is running wild, but few have been able to suggest coherent theories for the structure's origin. \n\nOne of the more promising theories doing the rounds is that the exterior of the pyramid is some kind of "giant puzzle lock". Should we authorize an attempt to unseal it?"
 mem_maze.4a:0 "Yes, get everything we need ready."
 mem_maze.4b:0 "We should not mess recklessly with alien artefacts."
 mem_maze.4b.tooltip:0 "We will do nothing with this structure."
 mem_maze.4c:0 "We should treat it as a divine artefact."
 mem_maze.4c.tooltip:0 "£unity  Unity output from the structure will increase, but we will not attempt to discover the mysteries it hides."
 
 mem_maze.5.name:0 "Alien Maze"
 mem_maze.5.desc:0 "Attempts to navigate the images and patterns engraved on the surface of the mysterious structure have finally yielded results. Pressing them in the correct order caused a hidden doorway to open, revealing the way inside. \n\nThe interior of the structure appears to be an endless maze of corridors, twisting and delving underground. We do not detect any energy sources, but the walls are glowing softly, enabling vision."
 mem_maze.5a:0 "We need to explore it further."
 
 mem_maze.6.name:0 "Failure of the First Expedition"
 mem_maze.6.desc:0 "As the team descended into tunnels, we lost all contact with them. \n\nWe waited a long time in hope of their return with good news, but the wait dragged on far longer than expected. Finally, one of the team members emerged from the depths of the maze, half-crazed and exhausted. They revealed that, as they navigated the maze, the team leader accidentally triggered a trip wire, which caused a giant boulder to roll through the corridor and squash them all, except for the sole survivor."
 mem_maze.6a:0 "We will try again, taking rolling boulders into account."
 mem_maze.6b:0 "This is unacceptable risk, seal the maze."
 mem_maze_cancellation: "We seal off the maze and will never return. \n§RThis decision can never be revised. Never.§!"
 
 mem_maze.7.name:0 "Failure of the Second Expedition"
 mem_maze.7.desc:0 "The second team was armed with advanced knowledge of mechanical traps and equipped with devices to evade them. As previously, we lost contact with them as they descended into the maze. We waited fruitlessly for some time, until several survivors emerged from the maze. \n\nThey told us that, despite their success in avoiding the traps, they were thwarted by some kind of puzzle guarding a door. It involves rearranging colourful beads fixed on the wireframe of a hypercube in order to somehow remove them by using extra dimensions. When the team failed to solve the puzzle, most of them were melted by an unknown form of radiation. Sketches carried by survivors should make it possible to decipher the solution in advance."
 mem_maze.7a:0 "We will try again, bringing our finished homework."
 
 mem_maze.8.name:0 "Failure of the Third Expedition"
 mem_maze.8.desc:0 "With access to our advanced computation machines, we were able to provide the team with a solution to the puzzle. Once more we lost contact as they departed, and once again we awaited their return. Eventually, a single survivor emerged from the maze with a new tale of failure. \n\nThis time, the team evaded the traps and successfully solved the hypercube puzzle. However, as they advanced further, they found themselves in a room with several slabs covered in riddles. Some were trivial to crack, but others were not. As the team discovered, mistakes were fatal. After almost the entire team was electrocuted by lightning bolts from the slabs, the last survivor chose to retreat and bring back the news, along with a transcript of all the riddles."
 mem_maze.8a:0 "We have gone too far. The riddles won't stop us."

 mem_maze.9.name:0 "Failure of the Fourth Expedition"
 mem_maze.9.desc:0 "A committee composed of our empire's most brilliant scientists, philosophers, folklorists and tabletop gamers provided the team with a list of what they believed to be solutions to the riddles in the maze. As they departed once again, we worriedly awaited their return. Eventually, several survivors have returned from the maze, again with bad news. \n\nDespite solving the riddle slabs with minimal casualties, the team was stopped by a complex mechanical puzzle that required the use of elaborate mechanisms and weights composed of exotic matter to produce a safe passage through a room without a floor, suspended over an abyss. In an attempt to solve the puzzle, the room was somehow rotated around the horizontal axis, fatally smashing most of the them into the ceiling. \n\nThe survivors were carrying a detailed scheme of the room, which should allow us to test solutions inside a virtual simulation first."
 mem_maze.9a:0 "We are almost there. We can't stop now."
 
 mem_maze.10.name:0 "Results of the Fifth Expedition"
 mem_maze.10.desc:0 "We prepared extensively before sending §Y[officer.GetName]§!'s team on the mission. As they departed, we patiently waited for the news. Suddenly, the radio silence was broken. It appears §Y[officer.GetName]§! made it to the centre of the maze! \n\n[officer.GetSheHeCap] describe[officer.GetSXX] a large hall with a brightly glowing green orb seated on the pedestal in the middle. According to the scientist, it's nothing like [officer.GetSheHe] [officer.GetHasHave] seen before. [officer.GetSheHeCap] think[officer.GetSXX] it is somehow... alive? \n\nSuddenly, the signal is interrupted. We are now receiving another signal originating from the same area!"
 
 mem_maze.11.desc:0 "We welcome you, wanderers. You have found us, and by doing so, proven your worth and determination. You are worthy of our audience. Worthy of our knowledge. \n\nBut first tell us, what is the greatest virtue for you?"
 mem_maze.11a:0 "We don't know."

 mem_maze.12.farewell:0 " Your answers are fascinating, wanderers. Now we shall provide our gifts."
 
 mem_maze.13.name:0 "Our Scientists Return"
 mem_maze.13.desc:0 "§Y[officer.GetName]§!'s team has emerged triumphant from the maze. They have trouble recollecting what really happened, but there is a spark of madness in their eyes. They demanded immediate access to the datapads, pens and paper, sticks and a patch of dirt, anything. After spending many hours drawing and writing, they appear to have returned to normal. Their works, meanwhile, appear to contain several of the answers many of our people have been searching for since the dawn of time!"
 mem_maze.13a:0 "We have learned so much."
 mem_maz.13a.tooltip: "Alien Maze will now produce a new job. Its output will depend on answers we provided."
