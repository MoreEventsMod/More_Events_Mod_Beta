Having access to the collected specimen our scientist will find whatever weakness these beasts might have - if they have one at all. We will need any edge we can get to protect what is rightfully ours should they ever return."

 # Scourge Story Line Intro
 mem_vazuran_systems.1a.desc:0 "The [root.GetName] reports to have reached the [root.solar_system.GetName]. The captain describes a cruesome scene. Multiple planets are shattered, the entire system littered with debris fields and even more peculiar seemingly organic husks are among these which do notmatch anything in our database. Further investigation is required."
 mem_vazuran_systems.1.a:0 "Commence an investigation."

 # Scourge Event Chain
 mem_vazuran_event_system_scourge_chain_title:0 "Devastated System"
 mem_vazuran_event_system_scourge_chain_desc:0 "Research the remains of the apocalyptic event that took place in the [mem_vazuran_event_system_01.GetName] system."
 mem_vazuran_event_system_scourge_projects_researched:0 "Finished Investigations"
 
 MEM_VAZURAN_EVENT_SYSTEM_SCOURGE_INVESTIGATION_01:0 "Bioship Investigation"
 MEM_VAZURAN_EVENT_SYSTEM_SCOURGE_INVESTIGATION_01_DESC:0 "Our scientists in the [root.solar_system.GetName] system have already identified atleast two distinct types of dead spaceborn lifeforms amidst the debris fiels. Though as of yet it is unclear if they are just different growth stages of one and the same species or two different species alltogether. "
 
 MEM_VAZURAN_EVENT_SYSTEM_SCOURGE_INVESTIGATION_02:0 "Debris Investigation"
 MEM_VAZURAN_EVENT_SYSTEM_SCOURGE_INVESTIGATION_02_DESC:0 "Among the countless debris fields a number of bigger wrecks remain which seem to be our chance of getting more inside about what happened here."

 # Finishing Bioship Investigation
 mem_vazuran_systems.101.name:0 "Genetic Engineering?"
 mem_vazuran_systems.101.desc:0 "After studying multiple specimens it is now clear that the different phenotypes - classified as [root.solar_system.GetName]-X1 and -X2 - are in fact different species despite sharing several genetical markers and characteristics. Between specimens of identical classification exists no genetical variation implying either asexual reproduction or cloning.\n\nThe organisms themselve appear to be the product of genetic engineering as natural evolution to their current state is highly unlikely. Both X1 and X2 feature exceptionally hardened carapaces similar in durability to military grade armor plates as well as organs which seemingly have acted as mass drivers for organic projectiles of which our exploration team has found a multitude still buried inside of various wrecks. Judging by the debris fields they must have been formidable combatants."
 mem_vazuran_systems.101.a:0 "Disconcerting."

 # Finishing Debris Investigation
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.name:0 "Sacrifice And Duty"
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.desc:0 "After spending multiple weeks exploring various wrecks within the vast debris field spanning across the [root.solar_system.GetName] system our exploration team made a breakthrough when their latest investigation object was not only revealed to have been the former fleet's flagship but to also house a still intact data storage from which they were able to reconstruct the events that have taken place here roughly four thousand years ago.\n\nTheir empire fought a desperate war against an extragalactic invading force of voidborn lifeforms which consumed every biomass in their way growing ever stronger the more they consumed.\n\nWhen the swarm was closing in on this once thriving population center of multiple settled worlds and only a token force in range to meet the attackers in time the admiral had to make a hard decision. Knowing he could neither save his people nor defeat his foes he decided to instead destroy every single colonized world in an effort to deny them the biomass they were coming for before engaging them in battle to give the rest of their fleet as much time as possible to close in on the threat.\n\nThe last entry of the admiral's log reads: §SSome may question my right to destroy planets with tens of billions of souls, but those who understand will realize that I had no right to let them live. No sacrifice can be too great when our entire galaxy is at stake. They did their duty and so shall we...§!\n\nOur mere existence seems to prove his sacrifice was not in vain."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.a:0 "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.b:0 "Extermination process already completed. Our service is not needed here."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.c:0 "How polite of them... They purged themselves so we don't have to."
 mem_vazuran_systems.102.d:0 "So much wasted biomass..."

 # Finishing Scourge Event Chain
 mem_vazuran_systems.103.name:0 "The Swarm"
 mem_vazuran_systems.103.desc:0 "With the knowledge of what once happened here and threat of another extragalactic invasion our scientists call for wideranging preparations should the swarm return. For all they know, this invasion force could have merely been a vanguard despite of how dangerous and threatening it was. Given this looming shadow on the horizon a few of them have already put forward a proposal to commit indepth studies on the available samples in order to find possible weaknesses to exploit, should we ever face this foe."
 mem_vazuran_systems.103.a:0 "We should prepare for this scenario."
