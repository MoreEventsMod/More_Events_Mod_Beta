 mem_the_ancient_signal_desc:0 "Our sensors have picked up a strange signal coming from a dense jungle area of the planet. We should send a science team to check out these readings."

 mem_the_ancient_signal.1.name:0 "Interesting Fauna?"
 mem_the_ancient_signal.1.desc:0 "We have found some interesting very dense flora that covers the surface of §Y[fauna_planet.GetName]§!. These faunae somehow are emitting quite a strong EM signal. We could establish a research post in orbit to learn more about these strange signals."

 mem_the_ancient_signal.2.name:0 "No New Findings"
 mem_the_ancient_signal.2.desc:0 "The scientists found nothing else interesting on the surface, it must have been a malfunction in the sensors that caused the excitement."

 mem_the_ancient_signal.3.name:0 "What is going on?"
 mem_the_ancient_signal.3.desc:0 "For the past months Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has been blabbering on about the mission on §Y[fauna_planet.GetName]§! saying we should go back. Over the past several days their condition has worsened and has devolved into a state of insanity whenever someone mentions the planet. They have also become paranoid of everyone and everything. A worrying sign indeed."
 mem_the_ancient_signal.3.a:0 "We must go back. We must find out what made this happen."

 MEM_THE_ANCIENT_SIGNAL_PROJECT:0 "Return to §Y[fauna_planet.GetName]§!."
 MEM_THE_ANCIENT_SIGNAL_PROJECT_DESC:0 "We must go back. We must find out what made this happen."

 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.name:0 "Alien Ruins?"
 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.desc_default:0 "Below the dense jungle, a gigantic ancient city is discovered. Apparently it was once inhabited by an alien race that dominated the planet a few hundred thousand years ago. This city is all that seems to be left of their civilisation. In the centre of the ruins stands an upright ring made out of an unknown material with 39 distinct symbols carved around it - one of them being the symbol for our empire. What could this mean?"

 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.a:0 "A great discovery!"
 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.b:0 "We can learn many things from this great device."
 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.c:0 "Filthy aliens, let's make sure none of their culture survives."

 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.a.tooltip:0 "So great we cannot even imagine what to say about it..."
 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.b.tooltip:0 "An amazing find! The population will be ecstatic at such a discovery! Population happiness increased by 10% for 365 days."
 mem_the_ancient_signal.4.c.tooltip:0 "Their culture could contaminate our own. Scrap what we can and set the charges."
