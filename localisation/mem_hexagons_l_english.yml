 mem_hexagon_dig_site: "Hexagonal Valleys"
 mem_hexagon_dig_site_desc: "A fraction of land on the surface of this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is covered in seemingly identical interlocking mountain ridges forming perfect hexagonal grid. This can't possibly be a natural formation."

 mem_hexagons.1.name: "Perfect Fit"
 mem_hexagons.1.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has completed basic examination of the strange hexagonal formations. \n\nThe initial observations were confirmed - not only the ridges themselves are identical, but so is the environment in the valleys between them. At least, it was so a long time ago - it seems nobody maintained them enough to ensure they don't diverge. The ridges themselves are unnaturally steep and nearly impossible to scale - it's likely whoever created the grid intended each valley to be  completely isolated."
 mem_hexagons.2.name: "Above the Ruins"
 mem_hexagons.2.desc: "Continued exploration has revealed that [From.Planet.GetName] was once a home to an industrial civilization. Cities that once stretched across the surface had been destroyed and bulldozed over. \n\nRadioactive traces suggest that the planet underwent a nuclear conflict many millenia years ago, but since then it was somehow restored to pristine condition so no traces on the surface remains."
 mem_hexagons.3.name: "Making Life"
 mem_hexagons.3.desc: "Our archaeologists working in the hexagon enclosures have discovered remains buried under them. They do appear to match remains of the dominant species found in the old ruins elsewhere on the planets, but contain a particular anomaly in their anatomy. \n\nUniformly adult they lack remainders of early development and growth, as if they were somehow weren't born and matured normally, but were created in a fully mature form from scratch. Who would do something like this remains a mystery. Oddly enough, those remains are noticeable younger than those found outside the area."
 mem_hexagons.4.name: "The Core"
 mem_hexagons.4.desc: "Digging further through the hexagonal areas we have found remains of an ancient technology. Well-secured cables running deep under the valleys, all converging on the same location. \n\n"
