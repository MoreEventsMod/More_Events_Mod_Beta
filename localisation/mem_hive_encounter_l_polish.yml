 mem_hive_encounter.2.name:0 "Intelligent Individual Life Forms"
 mem_hive_encounter.2.desc:0 "As the [root.GetName] begins to investigate the stars, we have come across a novel concept: Intelligence in individual life forms not linked to any overarching consciousness.\n\nThis is something we had previously thought to be impossible. We have dedicated considerable subroutines within our thought processes towards the question of how this came to be but have not yet made much progress. To speed up the process, perhaps we should ask the [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.GetName], one of the friendlier such societies, to provide us with some samples."
 mem_hive_encounter.2.a:0 "We will ask for their cooperation."
 mem_hive_encounter.2.b:0 "We do not need their help."

 # Normal empire receives hive proposal
 mem_hive_encounter.3.name:0 "Incoming Transmission"
 mem_hive_encounter.3.desc:0 "Greetings [root.species.GetNamePlural],\n\nAs we begin to explore the stars, we have encountered civilizations such as your own, which are not based on a hive mind. The concept of intelligence in individual life forms is novel to us and disproves many beliefs we had previously held to be true. We are puzzled as to how these circumstances came about, and wish to investigate.\n\nWe would therefore like to request that you send us some specimens of your species for us to examine. We promise that no damage to them will be incurred. In return, we can offer you both our favour and a sample of non-vital [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesAdj] drones upon which you may carry out your own experiments."
 mem_hive_encounter.3.a:0 "Of course. We will see whether there are any volunteers."
 mem_hive_encounter.3.b:0 "We can send you some of our criminals, we have no need of them."
 mem_hive_encounter.3.c:0 "We can send you some deceased samples."
 mem_hive_encounter.3.d:0 "We cannot help you."

 # volunteers found
 mem_hive_encounter.4.name:0 "Ready Volunteers"
 mem_hive_encounter.4.desc:0 "A number of volunteers have come forwards to act as test subjects for the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.species.GetNamePlural]. Motivated by a combination of curiosity, adventurousness and in some cases desperation, they are willing to leave their current lives behind and live in the Hive."
 mem_hive_encounter.4.b:0 "Excellent"

 # no volunteers found
 mem_hive_encounter.5.name:0 "No Volunteers to be Found"
 mem_hive_encounter.5.desc:0 "Our call for volunteers to acts as test subjects for the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetName] has fallen on deaf ears. We have not managed to persuade any participants to come forward. Should we find a way of acceding to the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesAdj] request anyway?"

 # hive receives answer
 mem_hive_encounter.6.desc.a:0 "We have found a group of ready volunteers who will act as your test subjects. We trust that you will make sure they are returned to us in the same state we sent them to you in!"
 mem_hive_encounter.6.desc.b:0 "We have decided that we can spare you certain undesirable elements from our prisons. We would highly appreciate it if you could ensure that they never return to [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.GetAdj] space."
 mem_hive_encounter.6.desc.c:0 "We will send you some samples of our deceased that nobody will miss. You may do with them as you please."
 mem_hive_encounter.6.desc.d:0 "We regret to inform you that we cannot help you. We do not find it appropriate to deliver the biological secrets of our species to foreign states, no matter how noble their intentions."
 mem_hive_encounter.6.a:0 "We appreciate your cooperation."
 mem_hive_encounter.6.b:0 "Unfortunate."

 # specimens arrive
 mem_hive_encounter.7.name:0 "The Research can Begin"
 mem_hive_encounter.7.desc.a:0 "The [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.species.GetName] specimens have arrived. Although they have been cooperative towards our investigations and even seem interested in finding out more about them, we are struggling to make sense of how their brains work. Each individual appears to spend a disturbing amount of time thinking an extremely large number of thoughts. Cross referencing between different subjects has confirmed that these thoughts are indeed arrived at independently of each other, and often diverge considerably. How can a society be based on such a lack of central direction?"
 mem_hive_encounter.7.desc.b:0 "The [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.species.GetName] specimens have arrived. They appear fearful of us, and express distress and anger at our sight. Interestingly, most of their anger is directed at their own government. It is hard for us to tell whether their behaviour is normal, given that these are outcasts who failed to fit into their society. Nonetheless, we are intrigued at the level of freedom of thought that is permitted in their society. How can a civilisation be based on such a lack of central direction?"
 mem_hive_encounter.7.desc.c:0 "The [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.species.GetName] specimens have arrived. It is regrettable that no live specimens were sent, meaning that we cannot examine the workings of the individual mind in action. However, we have prepared a series of experiments to see what secrets can be uncovered."
 mem_hive_encounter.7.a:0 "Let us begin our study."

 # results for hive
 mem_hive_encounter.8.name:0 "Successful Conclusion"
 mem_hive_encounter.8.desc.a:0 "Our investigation of the [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.species.GetName] specimens has proven fruitful. Not only have we gained an understanding of how life forms with individual intelligence interact with each other and with ourselves - providing us with many insights into alien behaviour - but we have also been able to conduct tests on the workings of their brains. It appears that, despite the massive difference between their civilisation and ours - and our biologies - in terms of neural and genetic structures, there is some degree of comparability. The main difference between them and us is that they lack the ability to link psionically, meaning that each mind is essentially left to its own devices. The individual [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.GetSpeciesAdj] brain is correspondingly far more developed than the average [root.GetSpeciesAdj] drone's.\n\nWe believe that, one day, we will be able to apply and remove the psionic link at will, essentially gaining us the ability to integrate other populations into the [root.GetName]. In the meantime, our understanding of the fundamentals of biology and statecraft have been advanced."

 # drones arrive
 mem_hive_encounter.9.name:0 "The Reseach can Begin"
 mem_hive_encounter.9.desc:0 "The drones from the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetName] have arrived. So far, they have proven unresponsive to our scientists - it appears that separating them from the rest of the Hive has essentially severed the force that was giving them life. Unable to think as independent individuals, they now lack direction, and are almost entirely dependent on our caretakers to be kept alive. Our scientists may have to act quickly if they are to find out much about them!"

 mem_hive_encounter.10.name:0 "Findings on the Hive Drones"
 mem_hive_encounter.10.desc.a:0 "Our scientists analysed the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesAdj] drones as best they could before the condition of the drones declined to such a state that they were pronounced dead. It appears that there is some sort of psionic link that binds the individual drone to the hive and allows the hive to control it. Despite the difficulties inherent in studying a phenomenon that could not be observed in action - we could not reactivate the link - some process was made by our scientists in understanding its nature and that of the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetName]. They were able to pinpoint the part of the brain used to establish the link, although their hypotheses into its functioning are largely speculative.\n\nThey do not believe that [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesAdj] drones are inherently incapable of independent thought - nothing in their neural structure would seem to preclude it, despite strong inhibitions which are in place to prevent it - it appears that the specimens provided are simply not developed enough to support it. If anything, they resemble pre-sapient life forms, but without a survival instinct to speak of.\n\nIn time, our scientists believe that we might come to be able to have the ability to create or remove the psionic link that binds the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural], effectively allowing us to create independent individual [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. However, that day lies in the distant future. In the meantime, our understanding of the fundamentals of biology and alien genetics has been advanced. Additionally, [mem_hive_encounter_leader.GetName] has discovered a new interest in psionics."

Of course, we could go back on our agreement and keep them for further study, but the [mem_hive_encounter_normal_country.species.GetNamePlural] will likely not take kindly to this!"
 mem_hive_encounter.11.a:0 "Send them back."
 mem_hive_encounter.11.b:0 "Retain them."

They claim to have had their "horizons broadened" by the "eye-opening" experience, whatever that means. By all accounts, the [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] proved to be good hosts, although the volunteers are certainly glad to be back in more familiar surroundings!"
 mem_hive_encounter.12.a:0 "Good to hear."

 mem_hive_encounter.13.desc:0 "The [mem_hive_encounter_hive_country.GetName] has refused to return us our volunteer subjects we had sent to them, despite the agreed date for their return having passed. They claim that they need more time to complete their research, and as this is a matter of vital security to the Organism, they do not feel bound by our previous agreement."
