 mem_lunar_gate.2.name:0 "The Lunar Gate"
 mem_lunar_gate.2.desc:0 "Prospectors on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] have discovered a large vein of unique elements that may enable the construction of a long range wormhole generator on the moon itself! Unlike the wormholes and natural gateways that are currently known to us, the proposed wormhole gate would connect [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] to every other colony in our space simultaneously!\n\nHowever, there are several issues: Firstly, the wormholes created by the Lunar Gate will be completely incompatible with our standard ship designs. Only small civilian ships will be able to access and use the gate, as the wormholes are much smaller and more unstable than our currently understood wormhole technology. While inconvenient for our military and our own civilian ships, the gate should greatly boost the colony's economy by providing near-instant contact with our other colonies.\n\nSecondly, the Lunar Gate will utilize a completely new wormhole theory and is thus untested. Our standard wormhole theory necessitates that wormholes only exist outside of the gravity well of a system. [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName]'s unique elements allow us to bypass this constraint, but the risk of failure is substantial.\n\nFinally, the construction of the Lunar Gate is not without cost: It will take a substantial investment to build the Gate."

 mem_lunar_gate.2.b:0 "Too much can go wrong. Study the elements instead."
 mem_lunar_gate.2.c:0 "It's too expensive. Study the elements instead."

 mem_lunar_gate.3.name:0 "Final Chance to Construct Lunar Gate"
 mem_lunar_gate.3.desc:0 "Local interest groups from [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] are demanding that we make a decision regarding the proposed Lunar Gate. It seems that the local government is losing its appetite for such an expensive and risky project. If construction for the Lunar Gate is to begin, it needs to begin now. However, if we have not set aside sufficient resources to afford the Gate, the colony's faith in the government will take a hit."

 mem_lunar_gate.3.c:0 "It's still too expensive. Study the elements instead."
 
 MEM_LUNAR_GATE_PROJECT:0 "Construct Lunar Gate"
 MEM_LUNAR_GATE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The construction of the Lunar Gate on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] will require one of our best scientists to pioneer the new miniature wormhole technology needed. With the construction of the Lunar Gate, the economy of [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] will be revolutionized by quick civilian access to all of our colonized space."
 
 mem_lunar_gate.4.name:0 "Lunar Gate Completed"
 mem_lunar_gate.4.desc:0 "The Lunar Gate on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] has been successfully activated and is revolutionizing [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName]! With transportation times to our other worlds cut to nearly zero, the economy is growing at an unprecedented rate. While we will need to monitor the Gate and [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] to ensure that there are no negative effects, it's safe to say that the Lunar Gate project has been a success."
 
 mem_lunar_gate.5.name:0 "Lunar Gate Disaster"
 mem_lunar_gate.5.desc:0 "An accident on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] has resulted in disaster for the Lunar Gate! When testing the gate, a gravitational anomaly caused a massive wormhole that ripped the moon apart. Needless to say, the Lunar Gate was lost along with the entirety of [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName]. Massive fragments of the former moon are raining down on [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] and have already destroyed several regions, devastating their populations. Additionally, the debris from [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] are interfering with the environment of [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] and causing health problems across the world. It will be quite some time before the colony recovers."
 mem_lunar_gate.5.a:0 "What a tragedy!"
 
 mem_lunar_gate.6.name:0 "Lunar Gate Collapse"
 mem_lunar_gate.6.desc:1 "An accident on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] has resulted in disaster for the Lunar Gate! When testing the gate, a wormhole collapsed and created a micro-black hole which consumed [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName]! Thankfully, the new black hole is in stable orbit around [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName] and does not appear to be interfering with [mem_lunar_gate_planet.GetName]. Our current projections do not predict the black hole evaporating in this millennium, so for now, the colony is safe. If nothing else, at least the new black hole will provide an interesting object of study."
