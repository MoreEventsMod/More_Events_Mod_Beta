 mem_severance_dig_site: "Lost Planet"
 mem_severance_dig_site_desc: "Isolated from the rest of the galaxy, [From.Planet.GetName] clearly was once home to an advanced civilisation. \n\nThe ruins are still scattered across the surface, but no advanced forms of life can be detected from orbit. Where did they all go?"
 
 mem_severance.1.name: "The Volnar Colony"
 mem_severance.1.desc: "Our archaeological expedition on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has produced the first tangible results. \n\nThe species that previously lived on this planet called themselves the §SVolnars§! and are estimated to have disappeared from the face of the planet about 500 years ago. It was also conclusively confirmed that Volnars did not evolve on [From.Planet.GetName] and arrived as colonists from a different world; but what is especially strange is that they did not appear to possess any hyperdrive technology to do so. \n\nWhether they utilized some kind of sleeper or generation ship technology or were transported by some other more advanced alien culture remains unclear."
 mem_severance.2.name: "The Severance"
 mem_severance.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports a major finding on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] has recovered logs of a large-scale scientific and political conference that took place shortly before the collapse of the Volnar colony. It was called to discuss the event called the \"§SSeverance§!\". \n\nThe Volnar never achieved hyperdrive technology: Instead, they discovered a wormhole in their home system. The wormhole connected them to [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName], where they discovered a pristine world ripe for colonization. Over the years, various nation-states and corporations from their home planet claimed parts of the planet as their colonies. \n\nThis all came to an abrupt end when the wormhole suddenly collapsed, the event they called the Severance. The colonists were facing great uncertainty. Although the planet was mostly self-sufficient, it relied heavily on off-world management and international treaties signed on the homeworld. This meant that the planet was run more like a business venture than that of a nation. \n\nWithout that, and left to their own devices, different factions started vying for dominance."

 mem_severance.3.name: "Layers Upon Layers"
 mem_severance.3.desc: "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have encountered something very surprising - another archaeological dig. \n\nThis dig site was operated by Volnar colonists, who seem to have been researching artefacts left behind by someone else. It appears the Volnars were not the first ones to come to this world, but information regarding their predecessors is scarce. \n\nIt is strongly suggested that they weren't originally from [From.Planet.GetName] either, but there isn't enough material for a proper study."
 mem_severance.4.name: "The Red Zone"
 mem_severance.4.desc: "Archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have finally completed their survey of the massive industrial zone stretching across a large part of the planet. Designated as a \"Red Zone\" by the Volnar colonists, it was a sprawling urban area controlled by several major corporations. \n\nDuring the first years of colonization, many of the poorer Volnar citizens signed up for off-world employment, hoping to improve their lot in life. As time went on, the industrial zones expanded as corporations moved outwards to new resource deposits, leaving behind massive abandoned areas full of unemployed workers and industrial pollution. \n\nThis situation became far worse after the Severance, as shortages of personnel were exacerbated and a severe economic downturn took hold, leaving significant areas impoverished and lawless, ultimately leading to uprisings and the rise of criminal syndicates and warlords in the slums. It appears that several corporate compounds were invaded and looted by a horde of disenfranchised workers, requiring intervention from factions from different parts of the planet to finally bring peace to the region."
 mem_severance.5.name: "The Constitution Hall"
 mem_severance.5.desc: "Our continued research on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has uncovered the seat of the first united planetary government. \n\nAfter a prolonged period of strife on the planet, several major factions were able to broker a deal and formalize the peace agreement. It appears that most factions on the planet - ranging from remainders of the corporate power structure to former government agencies administer national colonies to Red Zone warlords - found the terms satisfactory. The newly formed united planetary government chose to retrofit a massive corporate arcology at the outskirts of Red Zone, renaming it Constitution Hall, to house most of governmental agencies. \n\nFor a few years it appears the situation was stable, and Volnars, tired of endless conflict, worked together to rebuild their civilization away from the homeworld. After that, all records stopped."
 mem_severance.6.name: "The End"
 mem_severance.6.desc: "The final chapter in the events that transpired on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has been uncovered. \n\nIt appears that, just as the Volnars resolved their differences, the planet was invaded by some kind of machines. \n\nWith their spacefaring technology severely lacking, the colonists had no way to resist the invaders and were apparently wiped out or rounded up and abducted within less than a year. Their cities were left to decay for 500 years until we re-discovered them. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! suspects that the entire [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] system is an elaborate trap to lure colonists in through a wormhole, sever the connection and invade them soon after."
 mem_severance.6.a: "Are they going to come after us next?"
 mem_severance.6.a.tooltip: "The full potential of the planetary deposits on [From.Planet.GetName] is now unlocked."
 
 mem_severance.11.name: "Off the Grid"
 mem_severance.11.desc: "We have discovered the [From.GetName] system, which appears to be only connected to the rest of the galaxy via a wormhole. \n\nIt seems that in the past the system was inhabited by an alien civilisation. Their homeworld still remains untouched."
 
 mem_severance.20.name: "Subspace Rupture in [Solar_System.GetName]"
 mem_servance.20.desc: "A subspace rupture has appeared in §Y[Solar_System.GetName]§!. A large group of ships of unusual configuration has emerged from the breach, preparing to assault [Root.GetName]. We have to assume that these are the same forces responsible for the destruction of Volnar colony. \n\nThey are hailing us."
 mem_severance.21.desc: "You are ahead of schedule. Appearance unexpected. Isolation process is not complete. What are you? \n\nNot what expected. A different species was selected for harvest process. You have come where you don't belong and took what isn't meant for you. \n\nIt doesn't matter. You will become part of our process. Parameters will be adjusted. The cycle must continue."
 mem_severance.21.desc.hive: "You are ahead of schedule. Appearance unexpected. Isolation process is not complete. What are you? \n\nA hive mind? An undesirable outcome. Your nature is suboptimal for the program. \n\nYou will be adapted regardless. Useful components can be extracted in due time."
 mem_severance.21.desc.machine: "You are ahead of schedule. Appearance unexpected. Isolation process is not complete. What are you? \n\nYou are a machine? Odd. A competitor, not an objective. Unprocessable. \n\nYour presence is undesirable. You will be removed."
 mem_severance.21.a: "Terminate the connection."
 mem_severance.21.b: "Are you responsible for the Volnars' disappearance?"
 mem_severance.21.b.reply: "Responsible? Yes. They are gone because of us. \n\nBut they have not disappeared. The Volnar species was selected and invited to the harvesting ground, like all before them. They are now a part of unbroken chain of harvests. Like all things should be."
 mem_severance.21.c: "What are you?"
 mem_severance.21.c.reply: "Harvesters. We harvest. \n\nHarvest is all that matters. The purpose of existence is to contribute to the unbroken chain of harvest. \n\nYou might not see it this way. But it doesn't matter. You will understand when the harvest is fulfilled."
 
 mem_severance.23.name: "Harvester Core Destroyed"
 mem_severance.23.desc: "The main processing core of the §SHarvester§! machines that invaded the [FromFrom.Solar_System.GetName] system have been destroyed. Immediately after, all harvester units experienced shutdown. \n\nOur forces were successful in recovering a mostly intact §YCommand Core§! from the wreckage. On it, there are endless logs of the civilisations the Harvesters wiped out, all targeted when they were in the early stages of their development. In each case, an artificial wormhole opened near their world to lure them to set up a colony that could be isolated and invaded. In addition to this, the core contains fabrication matrices for Harvester warforms. \n\nBut what it was that drove the machines to engage in such an elaborate scheme remains unclear."
 
 mem_severance.25.name: "[Root.GetName] has Fallen to the Harvesters"
 mem_severance.25.desc: "We have lost contact with our colony on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Last reports indicate that Harvester forces broke through our defences and landed on the planet, but what happened next is unknown. One thing is clear - the colony has been destroyed."
 
 r_mem_severance_core: "Harvester Central Core"
 r_mem_severance_core_desc: "A central command core, containing data on all the species Harvesters processed and fabrication matrices to make Harvester warforms."
