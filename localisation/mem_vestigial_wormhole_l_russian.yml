 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.2.desc: "The §Y[From.GetName]§! system contains an unusual feature - a §Swormhole§!. \n\nThis one, however, is highly unstable. Perhaps in the distant past it was possible to travel through it to distant worlds, but now it's near complete collapse. Its chaotic nature makes it impossible to travel through: it's highly unlikely anything could ever enter or leave it."
 
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.name: "Vestigial Wormhole"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.desc: "The wormhole in the §Y[the_system.GetName]§! system has proven to be less unstable than we had thought. \n\nToday, against all odds, an alien ship emerged from it. This seems to have been the final straw - moments later the wormhole completely collapsed. \n\nThe ship is unlike any other ship have encountered before. It appears to be completely inert and is slowly drifting through the system."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.3.b: "Blast the intruder out of the sky."
 
 MEM_VESTIGIAL_WORMHOLE_PROJECT: "Investigate the mysterious ship"

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.4.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports that following the boarding of the unidentified ship that entered the [the_system.GetName] system through a collapsing wormhole, [Leader.GetSheHe] has found something unexpected: A living pilot. \n\nA short interrogation revealed the truth: The pilot was a scientist exploring the wormhole when some kind of spatial anomaly destabilized it. Comparison between our star charts and those stored aboard the ship suggests that [the_guy.GetHerHis] journey began several galaxies away, about 2 billion years ago."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.desc.psi: "As the [Root.GetName] approached the derelict vessel in the [Solar_System.GetName] system, [Leader.GetName] sensed many minds inside: Cold, alien ravenous minds waiting for the prey to come to them. \n\nA closer look revealed that the ship is filled with large and aggressive eight-legged creatures. Avoiding an ambush thanks to [Leader.GetHerHis] premonition, [Leader.GetName] wisely opted to retreat and scuttle the ship in order to contain the biological hazard."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.desc.cyborg: "The derelict vessel in the [Solar_System.GetName] system has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we had expected. \n\nOnce the [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures. One of them even managed to get close to [Leader.GetName], only to be incinerated by [Leader.GetHerHis] newly installed personal defense system. \n\nThe crew was forced to retreat, scuttling the ship in process to avoid possible contamination."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.6.desc.robot: "The derelict vessel in the [Solar_System.GetName] system has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we had expected. \n\nOnce [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures that were, however, unable to penetrate their armor and do any harm. \n\nIn order to avoid any possible infestation, [Leader.GetName] decided to scuttle the ship."

One of them even managed to ambush [Leader.GetName], but as it bit [Leader.GetHerHim], [Leader.GetHerHis] augmented immune system identified the threat and proved to be quite deadly to would-be predator. \n\nHowever, unwilling to test [Leader.GetHerHis] luck further, [Leader.GetName] opted to leave and scuttle the ship to prevent further contamination."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.7.name: "Giant Space Spiders"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.7.desc: " The derelict vessel in the [Solar_System.GetName] system has proven to not be as abandoned and lifeless as we had expected. \n\nOnce [Root.GetName] docked with it, the science team was beset by an army of large eight-legged creatures. Before they could react, one of the largest attacked [bitten_leader.GetName], attaching itself to [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] body and causing [bitten_leader.GetHerHim] to slip into a deep coma. The team had to withdraw, scuttling the ship to avoid further contamination."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.desc: "A month after being bitten, [bitten_leader.GetName] has woken up in a medical facility on [Capital_Scope.GetName]. But [bitten_leader.GetSheHe] [bitten_leader.GetHasHave] changed. \n\n[bitten_leader.GetHisHerCap] old personality is gone, apparently replaced by a giant spider still attached to [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] body. Talking through its host, the creature made contact. It calls itself §YEight-Legs§! and claims to be a part of an ancient and advanced species. \n\nWhile admitting to effectively killing [bitten_leader.GetName], it has offered to make up for it by serving our empire in [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] stead."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.desc.hive: "[bitten_leader.GetName] woke up again, but it has changed. We no longer sense [bitten_leader.GetHerHim] as a part of us. \n\nA new, cold and dark mind has replaced it inside: A creature calling itself §YEight-Legs§! has possessed over [bitten_leader.GetHerHis] body. It offers to serve us now, in exchange for its life. Can we trust it?"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.a: "Accept Eight-Legs in our service."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.8.a.tooltip: "§Y[bitten_leader.GetName]§! will return to our service as §YEight-Legs§!. \nThey will gain §Y$mem_vestigial_wormhole_scientist_spider$§! trait, giving §G+10%§! to research speed."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.name: "Ghost Ship"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports successfully boarding the mysterious ship that appeared through the wormhole in the [Solar_System.GetName] system. \n\nWhat [Leader.GetSheHe] and [Leader.GetHerHis] crew found inside is difficult to explain. The ship is clearly designed with an organic crew in mind, but no living beings or identifiable remains were found. The only thing that suggests organics were once there is an empty space suit still strapped to the pilot's chair. There is no indication as to what could've happened to pilot, assuming one even existed in the first place. \n\nThe ship seems to be designed for exploration and can be repurposed as another science vessel."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.a: "Make it so."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.a.tooltip: "We gain a new §Sscience ship§!"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.9.b: "Dismantle the ship and study its secrets."

 mem_vestigial_wormhole.10.name: "Spirited Away"
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.10.desc: "The [Root.GetName] reports successfully boarding the strange vessel that recently appeared in the [Solar_System.GetName] system. \n\nHowever, right after [stolen_leader.GetName] stepped aboard, the ship suddenly vanished from the sensors. It's not clear what happened, but spatial distortions left in the ship's wake suggest that it has been sucked back into the wormhole from whence it had emerged, which we mistakenly thought to be closed. Without any means of following the ship, [stolen_leader.GetName] will have to be written off as a casualty."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.10.a: "Spatial anomalies have claimed another victim..."
 mem_vestigial_wormhole.10.a.tooltip: "§Y[stolen_leader.GetName]§! is gone."
