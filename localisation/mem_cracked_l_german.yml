 mem_cracked_category:0 "Cracked"
 mem_cracked_category_desc:0 "A web of fault lines covers this asteroid, but they do not originate from an external impact - it's as if it was cracked from the inside. Our instruments have detected a faint energy signature emanating from the asteroid."

 mem_cracked.1.name:0 "Point of Entry"
 mem_cracked.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that deep penetration scans of §Y[From.GetName]§! have detected an unusual object beneath its surface - right where fault lines are presumed to originate. \n\nConjecture regarding the object has run rampant, but §Y[Root.Leader.GetName]§! believes the results indicate that a ship is somehow trapped inside of the asteroid. Tremors within the asteroid immediately followed the initial transmission. Whatever is inside it, the asteroid will not remain stable for long."
 mem_cracked.1.a:0 "Find a way to extract this ship."
 mem_cracked.1.b:0 "Attempt to conserve the site for prolonged study."
 mem_cracked.1.c:0 "Study the strange phenomenon that caused this."

 MEM_CRACKED_CUT_OUT:0 "Extraction"
 MEM_CRACKED_CUT_OUT_DESC:0 "Whatever is trapped inside the asteroid, we require precision mining equipment to bring it out safely. A construction ship can do the job."

 mem_cracked.2.name:0 "Warship from Beyond"
 mem_cracked.2.desc:0 "A ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. Seemingly composed primarily of energy fields, it looks and functions very differently from our own technology. No crew was found inside. \n\nOur findings suggest that this ship originated outside our current dimension, raising a great many questions for the [Owner.GetAdj] scientific community to ponder. Despite its unusual design, it could still be repurposed to serve in our military fleet."
 mem_cracked.2.tooltip:0 "A new §Ymilitary ship§! will join our empire."

 mem_cracked.3.name:0 "Science Vessel from Beyond"
 mem_cracked.3.desc:0 "A ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. Seemingly composed primarily of energy fields, it looks and functions very differently from our own technology. No crew was found inside. \n\nOur findings suggest that this ship originated outside our current dimension, raising a great many questions for the [Owner.GetAdj] scientific community to ponder. Despite its unusual design, it could still be repurposed to serve in our exploration fleet."
 mem_cracked.3.tooltip:0 "A new §Yscience ship§! will join our empire."

 mem_cracked.4.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_cracked.4.desc:0 "The extraction crew misread a survey of the asteroid's internal activity and triggered its total destruction through ill-advised drilling. However, a ship was indeed trapped inside the asteroid. Examining its debris will provide some fascinating scientific data on this bizarre ship that shows no similarity to any vessel or material we've yet discovered."
 mem_cracked.4.a:0 "Could've been better."

 mem_cracked.5.name:0 "Jack-In-The-Rock"
 mem_cracked.5.desc:0 "We got it almost right - except that it wasn't one ship trapped inside the asteroid, but two. As we finished freeing them from the rock, both ships immediately powered up and directed their weapon systems toward us."
 mem_cracked.5.a:0 "Those invaders must be contained."

 mem_cracked_ship_mod:0 "Otherworldly Energies"
 mem_cracked_ship_war_buff:0 "Otherworldly Energies"

 mem_cracked.10.name:0 "A Crack in Space"
 mem_cracked.10.desc:0 "Whatever shattered asteroid §Y[From.GetName]§! has vanished in a cacophony of energy as [Root.GetName] approached for second scan. After recovering from the incident, our crew reported that their ship's hull was strangely altered by the bizarre traveller. Whatever their origin, their technology has inspired theoretical debate over hyperdrives capable of tearing through the fabric of space."
 mem_cracked.10.a:0 "How strange..."

 mem_cracked.9999.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_cracked.9999.desc:0 "Despite [Leader.GetHerHis] best efforts, [Leader.GetName] was not able to identify the cause of mysterious cracks spreading through §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§!. A freak accident for sure, it will likely forever remain beyond our knowledge, leaving us able to only study its consequences."
 mem_cracked.9999.a:0 "That's a shame."
