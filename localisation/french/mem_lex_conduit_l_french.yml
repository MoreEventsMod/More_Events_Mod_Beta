 mem_the_conduit.1.desc:0 "Our sensors have picked up something most unusual, even by our standards. The [From.GetName] system appears to have four large "obelisk" type structures centered around the local star that looks most intruiging. We can't discern any energy signals from the objects, but the shielded world in the system might have some answers."

 mem_the_conduit.5.desc:0 "Our scientists in the [mem_garden_system.GetName] system have discovered a way to penetrate the energy barrier surrounding [mem_shielded_target.GetName]. Our preliminary scans make it out to be some kind of garden world. How should we proceed?"

The population is demoralized and dismayed, many driven to insanity by the presence of the invaders, with several splinter groups still under the aliens' lingering influence. It will take time and care to restore the people's morale. Yet many questions remain unanswered, most prominently among them: just what was the purpose of this invasion?"
