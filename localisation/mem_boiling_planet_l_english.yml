 mem_boiling.1.title:0 "The Boiling Planet"
 mem_boiling.1.desc:0 "Deep probing has shown that [From.From.GetName] is not as "frozen" as we had assumed. What we had thought to be its outer crust is actually only a relatively thin layer of ice covering a vast ocean. In fact, most of its mass is made up of water, with a highly active overheated core that creates a potent geothermal heater. The water boils near the core, but cools as it rises to the surface and freezes into a several kilometres thick layer of ice."
