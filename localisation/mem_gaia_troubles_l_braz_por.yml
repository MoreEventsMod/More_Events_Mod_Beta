 mem_gaia_troubles.name:0 "New Gaia World"
 mem_gaia_troubles.desc:0 "This Gaia world is perfect for us. Exploration of the planet has already begun."
 
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.name:0 "A Hammer?"
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.desc:0 "In an underground cave on §Y[From.GetName]§!, a scouting party has discovered an amazing network of caves that seems to go on for miles under the surface. While searching the caves, we have seemingly stumbled upon a very large cavern. The cavern is very unnatural, almost circular in shape. In the centre lies a small rock with an object that is emitting a weak EM signal. The object is of unexpected design - it can only be described as analogous to a medieval war hammer!"
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.a:0 "Leave it untouched, it's none of our concern."
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.b:0 "Remove this artifact and take it to our capital for study."
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.c:0 "Open to the public as an exhibition."
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.d:0 "We should inspect it here on the planet without moving it."
 mem_gaia_troubles.2.e:0 "EM signals you say? Let's see if it responds to ours."

 mem_gaia_troubles.3.name:0 "Untouched Artifact"
 mem_gaia_troubles.3.desc:0 "Our choice to leave the artifact untouched means we may be missing out on discovering some ancient technology, but we'd rather not take the risk in releasing something that could harm this great planet that we have."
 mem_gaia_troubles.3.a:0 "At least nothing bad came of this!"

 mem_gaia_troubles.4.name:0 "Troubling changes"
 mem_gaia_troubles.4.desc:0 "Hazardous weather has sprung up on §Y[From.GetName]§!. Some of our more wild minded scientists have suggested that it could be because of us removing the artifact from §Y[From.GetName]§!. The majority of the science community however believes this to merely be a coincidence."
 mem_gaia_troubles.4.a:0 "How did these people get their positions again?"
 mem_gaia_troubles.4.b:0 "Return it, better to be safe than sorry."

 mem_gaia_troubles.5.name:0 "Troubling changes"
 mem_gaia_troubles.5.desc:0 "Massive tectonic activity is occurring on §Y[From.GetName]§!, and given that the planet usually has little such activity, it is making the populace on the planet quite concerned. Many cities have been severely damaged by the quakes. Reports from the scientific community suggest that more scientists now support the idea that these strange happenings were caused by us removing the artifact."
 mem_gaia_troubles.5.a:0 "This is merely a coincidence."
 mem_gaia_troubles.5.b:0 "We must stop. Return the artifact."

 mem_gaia_troubles.6.name:0 "Troubling changes"
 mem_gaia_troubles.6.desc:0 "Something extraordinary has happened on §Y[From.GetName]§!. The planet's gravity has increased massively. Our lead scientists are baffled as to how this has exactly happened."
 mem_gaia_troubles.6.a:0 "The work must continue!"
 mem_gaia_troubles.6.b:0 "Okay... time to return this artifact now."

 mem_gaia_troubles.7.name:0 "Troubling changes"
 mem_gaia_troubles.7.desc:0 "The entire ecosystem of §Y[From.GetName]§! has collapsed before our very eyes. Forests have ceased to exist, oceans have dried up and deserts have spread across the entire planet. Millions of our people are now living in a world that is very different to the one they knew just a short while ago. The majority of the scientific community is now urging us to return the artifact to the planet amid fears that it could get even worse. The scientific gains we are getting from the artifact are immense, however."
 mem_gaia_troubles.7.a:0 "Press on, no matter the cost!"
 mem_gaia_troubles.7.b:0 "We can stop this before it's too late!"

 mem_gaia_troubles.8.name:0 "Troubling changes"
 mem_gaia_troubles.8.desc:0 "No. That can't have happened. We should have listened to them..."
 mem_gaia_troubles.8.a:0 "It is too late now..."

 mem_gaia_troubles.9.name:0 "Troubling changes"
 mem_gaia_troubles.9.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! is now a husk of a planet that it once was. Now filled with poisonous gases, it is unlikely that life will ever live there again."
 mem_gaia_troubles.9.a:0 "Maybe we went too far this time..."

 mem_gaia_troubles.10.name:0 "Artifact Returned"
 mem_gaia_troubles.10.desc:0 "Knowing that we are out of our depth with whatever this artifact is, the decision to return it has been welcomed by many parts of the scientific community. While some still want to perform tests, their thirst for whatever secrets that it may hold will have to wait until another day."
 mem_gaia_troubles.10.a:0 "At least nothing else bad can happen, right?"

 mem_gaia_troubles.20.name:0 "EM Tests"
 mem_gaia_troubles.20.desc:0 "Equipment is being transported to §Y[From.GetName]§! in preparation for the tests. You will be notified when they begin shortly."

 mem_gaia_troubles.21.name:0 "EM Tests"
 mem_gaia_troubles.21.desc:0 "The last round of tests revealed some more tidbits about the artifact, but not enough to make any solid conclusions. What should our next move be with regards to the strength of the EM beam?"
 mem_gaia_troubles.21.a:0 "Up the intensity and try again."
 mem_gaia_troubles.21.b:0 "Let's try lowering it a little."

 mem_gaia_troubles.22.name:0 "EM Tests"
 mem_gaia_troubles.22.desc:0 "The last round of tests revealed some more information about the artifact, but not enough to make any solid conclusions. What should our next move be with regards to the strength of the EM beam?"
 mem_gaia_troubles.22.a:0 "Up the intensity and try again."
 mem_gaia_troubles.22.b:0 "Let's try lowering it a little."

 mem_gaia_troubles.23.name:0 "EM Tests"
 mem_gaia_troubles.23.desc:0 "The EM tests have yielded no information of any use to us. The only thing we know now is not to be so quick to jump to conclusions with things that we have no understanding of."

 mem_gaia_troubles.24.name:0 "EM Tests"
 mem_gaia_troubles.24.desc:0 "We seemed to have 'activated' the artifact. Well, we aren't quite sure what we have done. After tuning the EM beam to a specific frequency, a number of drones shot up from hidden pods in the floor of the cave and headed for the upper atmosphere, going straight through the ceiling! Our satellites have detected that their weapons are charging up. We should prepare to defend ourselves."
