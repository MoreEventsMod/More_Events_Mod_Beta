 tech_mem_world_eater_lure_desc: "There's a massive distortion in the depth of hyperspace. Such a distortion may be caused by a single massive object in transit - as if an entire planet or something else of similar mass is being hauled fast than light. Even though our ships might never be able or need to go this deep, understanding the strange undercurrents of the hyperspace can be vital to our understanding."
