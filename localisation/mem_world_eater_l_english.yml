 mem_world_eater.3.name: "Hyperspace Shadow"
 mem_world_eater.3.desc: "Our sensors are detecting a massive distortion in the hyperspace network. \n\nSuch a distortion may be caused by a single massive object in transit - as if an entire planet or something else of similar mass is being hauled fast than light. If so, it could be the most massive object we have encountered so far - and it's heading towards our galaxy. \n\nIt is predicted to arrive within a year."

 mem_world_eater.5.name: "The Eater of Worlds Arrives"
 mem_world_eater.5.desc: "Fabric of space and time is breached inside [ingress_point.GetName] System, leaving behing a persistent spatial anomaly. Out of it emerged a being unlike any other - a living planet. Our scans indicate that the entire almost entire body of this creature is composted of biomass of radically different origin, presumably obtained from different planets, possibly even different galaxies. \n\nIt is truly the eater of worlds - and it's here to feed."
 mem_world_eater.6.desc: "Our long-distance sensors detect a massive breach inside [ingress_point.GetName] System. It appars a sort of living planet have emerged from hyperspace there, and from what we can gather, it must be composed of biomass coming from different planets. \n\nIt is truly the eater of worlds - and it's here to feed."
