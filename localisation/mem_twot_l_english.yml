 mem_twot_dig_site_desc: "Ancient ruins cover an isolated region of the planet. Feared and avoided by the native [mem_twot_species.GetNamePlural], they show technological level far exceeded the other regions in its archetecture, but no life signs or energy signatures are detected within. \n\nThe ruins are too primitive to be built by visiting aliens, but why only a fraction of the planet is industrialized is unclear."

 mem_twot.1.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! report initial survey results in the outskirts of the ancient ruins on [From.Planet.GetName]. The architechture and machinery does seem to fit [mem_twot_species.GetAdj] physiology, indicating that it was built by the natives of the planet, or at the very least for them. The level of technology is falling slightly short of space travel, though it does feature heavier then usual automation. \n\nA great deal of infrastructure discovered is automatic defence systems. The perimeter is protected with robotic turrets, artillery encampments and full-automatic drone airfields. No sign of battle damage is apparent, but all the defences seem inert, as if they were turned off at some point. \n\nThe main gate to the inner city is dominated by a massive banner saying §S"Welcome to the World of Tomorrow!§! in ancient [mem_twot_species.GetAdj] dialect."
