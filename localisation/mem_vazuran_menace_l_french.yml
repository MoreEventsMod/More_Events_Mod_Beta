[root.Leader.GetName], though able to pinpoint its source, quickly discarded the idea of trying to reach it as too dangerous.\n\nBack aboard the [root.GetName], [root.Leader.GetSheHe] managed to decipher the recorded transmission.\n\nIt consisted of several minutes of video feed starting in the middle of what appears to have been a live news report about a public celebration.\n\n§SLarge parades are carrying debris through the streets accompanied by cheering masses, until suddenly the atmosphere changes completely and panic spreads. Then the view is abruptly moved towards the darkening sky. A burning wreck draws a fiery line as it falls towards the ground.

Their growing resistance was met with increasingly brutal retaliations, and they feared - rightfully, it seems - that their world would fall to these attacks.

Several personnel experienced what they described as psychotic episodes during these moments. Affected by this phenomenon as well, the chief scientist decided to return to the shuttle, fearing that remaining longer would put the team in danger. However, before they could lift off, another blackout occurred, lasting for much longer than any before that point.

According to [root.Leader.GetHisHer] theory, [From.GetName]'s inhabitants must have possessed extensive psychic capabilities, which led to their terrifying last moments being imprinted into the planet itself. Though physically unharmed, the events have had a lasting effect on [root.Leader.GetHimHer].\n\nFurther scans showed traces of a superdense compound spread across the planet's surface, which is likely to originate from the weapons used in its destruction, supporting [root.Leader.GetName]'s claims."

These events must have taken place many thousands of years ago, and remnants on the surface are too decayed and eroded to draw any further conclusions.\n\nJust as [root.Leader.GetName] was about to wrap up [root.Leader.GetHisHer] investigations, the [root.GetName]'s scanners picked up a set of tiny, suspiciously identical objects orbiting [From.GetName]'s moon. These turned out to be artificial satellites containing data cores. The chief scientist assumes these were meant to be found and act as some kind of time capsules.\n\nHowever, it will take significant effort to access and decipher the data stored within them."

So far, it appears that each exemplar is an exact replica of the others and contains the same information - presumably as a strategy to increase the likelihood of its preservation. The data contained is extremely vast, and will take our scientists months, if not years to fully decipher.\nThe first entry, apparently a title page, has already been translated:\n\n"We thought ourselves invincible. We thought we could stop the 'Destroyers'. We were not a young race like the others they have brought down - we have travelled the galaxy for a millennium. But they have bested us. By the time this message is found, nothing else will remain of our once proud race. We leave this record in the hope that our most prized treasure, the words of our greatest philosophers -- our cultural heritage -- might outlive the extinction of our race.""

 mem_vazurans.260.desc:0 "After running multiple experiments on the salvaged damper field generator, our [root.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] were able to establish a solid understanding of its capabilities. Unlike our shields, which absorb the energy of incoming attacks until they are depleted, the field this generator creates permanently suppresses energy transmissions so that only a fraction of them reach the protected object.\n\nWhile it works against any kind of weapon, tests have shown it to be most effective against energy-based ones. Though the application of this technology to our own fleet might seem tempting at first, our experiments demonstrated problematic side-effects caused by this protective device. The suppression of energy transmission is not limited on energy coming from outside its zone of effect but affects internal ship systems as well. So far, no way of shielding them from the damper field's effects has been found.\n\nOur [root.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] have only managed to gain a rudimentary understanding of the technology's underlying scientific principles. However, this is nonetheless a significant step in overcoming the Vazuran technological superiority and should improve our chances in battles against their ships."
