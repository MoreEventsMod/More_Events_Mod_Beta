 mem_ex_planet.301.title:0 "An Intriguing Discovery"
 mem_ex_planet.301.desc:0 "Our mining station at [mem_ex_planet.GetName] reports that they have found something very interesting: fossils! Mixed in with the ore from the latest excavation, they found fossils of lifeforms resembling large insects. Our initial survey of [mem_ex_planet.GetName] showed that the asteroid was a fragment of a planet that exploded, and found traces of long-dead bacteria in the rock, but this is our first indication that the planet had macroscopic life forms. The miners are requesting a science ship to investigate."
 mem_ex_planet.301.a:0 "We will send a ship at once."
 mem_ex_planet.301.b:0 "All our ships are busy at present."

 mem_ex_planet.303.title:0 "Planetary Remains"
 mem_ex_planet.303.desc:0 "Our science ship has confirmed the discovery of fossils at [mem_ex_planet.GetName] - and not just a few, but a whole vein of them! The life forms that inhabited the planet that broke up to form [mem_ex_planet.GetName] had a number of unusual features, and access to their remains will no doubt expand our knowledge of biology considerably."
 mem_ex_planet.303.a:0 "Excellent!"
