 mem_premature_ageing_category_desc:0 "[From.GetName]'s mass, energy output, and spectral patterns lie outside the usual parameters for stars of its class and maturity, indicating accelerated ageing."
 
 mem_premature_ageing.1.name:0 "Failure"
 mem_premature_ageing.1.desc:0 "The star is, without a doubt, ageing faster than we anticipated and is projected to go supernova in less than two billion years - at least two billion years too soon. However, we could not determine the cause of this anomaly."
 mem_premature_ageing.1.a:0 "Too bad."
 
 mem_premature_ageing.2.name:0 "Solar Extinguisher"
 mem_premature_ageing.2.desc:0 "Long dormant energy traces in subspace and breaching points near the star's corona suggest that [From.GetName]'s rapid ageing was artificially induced. It appears that, millions of years ago, an energy beam from a distant system was launched at the star using technology far beyond our current understanding. \n\nWhether it was a weapon or an exercise in cosmic-scale civil engineering, the beam ripped through the star's core, upsetting fusion processes inside it in an attempt to cause the star to go supernova. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately), it failed to fully achieve its destructive goal, but anyone present here in two billion years will be able to fully appreciate the effect."
 mem_premature_ageing.2.normal:0 "It's a shame we can't trace the weapon's origin point."
 mem_premature_ageing.2.alternate:0 "We should be able to trace the weapon's origin point."
 
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_TRACING_PROJECT:0 "Trace the Solar Extinguisher"
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_TRACING_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A powerful weapon ripped through the time-space continuum and transported an enormous amount of energy at faster-than-light speed. Even millions of years later, the subspace breach points are lingering near the star, and with some skill, we should be able to trace the weapon's origin point."
 
 mem_premature_ageing.3.name:0 "Origin Point Found"
 mem_premature_ageing.3.desc:0 "We're in luck! Methods that are normally useless in tracing usual subspace activity have proven to be useful on this particular occasion due to the enormous amount of energy that was used. We have pinpointed the origin point of this energy transfer to a remote system."
 
 #Event chain
 mem_premature_ageing_chain_title:0 "Find the Weapon's Origin Point"
 mem_premature_ageing_chain_desc:0 "We should try to find the weapon's origin point. From there, we might be able to learn more about the technology that was used to age this star so quickly."
 mem_premature_ageing_asteroid_checked:0 "Origin Point Found"
 
 #Point of Interest
 mem_premature_ageing_weapon_origin.1.name:0 "Weapon's Origin Point"
 mem_premature_ageing_weapon_origin.1.desc:0 "Location from where the weapon was supposedly fired."
 
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_ANALYZE_PROJECT:0 "Examine the Asteroid"
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_ANALYZE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "We were able to locate a residue breach point near the system's asteroid belt. If we hadn't known what to look for, we wouldn't even have noticed it, but it appears be the most promising place to look for the solar extinguisher."
 
 mem_premature_ageing.5.name:0 "Solar Extinguisher"
 mem_premature_ageing.5.desc:0 "For the uninitiated, it might look like just an ordinary space rock, but we know better. With our scanners uniquely calibrated, we can see that this asteroid was once a part of an extremely advanced power transfer system. What seems like simple metal deposits to others is actually advanced circuitry that was once running within a planet's crust.\n\nIt appears the first use of the extremely powerful weapon was its last - the massive energy overload tore the planet housing it apart, turning it into the asteroid belt we now see. The ancient technology hidden inside is millennia ahead of us, but even in this state, mapping out the power distribution circuitry offers us invaluable insight into energy weapon technology."
 
 mem_premature_ageing_solar_extinguisher_tech:0 "Solar Extinguisher Technology"
 mem_premature_ageing_solar_extinguisher_tech_desc:0 "With the study of this technology, we have been able to fine tune our energy weapons so that they can deal damage more efficiently."
