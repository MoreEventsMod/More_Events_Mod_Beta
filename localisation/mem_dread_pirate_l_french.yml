 mem_dread_pirate.2.name: "Legend of the Dread Pirate"
 mem_dread_pirate.2.desc: "After destroying one of the raiding ships sent by the §S[marauder_sender.GetName]§! in the §Y[combat_system.GetName] system§!, our forces have recovered an intact datacore with some interesting information. \n\nThe core tells of a §SDread Pirate Raewynn§! who was somewhat of a [marauder_sender.GetAdj] legend. He roamed the galaxy centuries before the [Root.GetName] ventured into space and apparently disappeared somewhere in the §Y[the_planet.Solar_System.GetName] system§!. Otherwise an unremarkable [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon], [the_planet.GetName] is now believed to be his resting place. \n\nEven though we have surveyed this [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] before and didn't find anything related to it, this new data might warrant a closer look."
 mem_dread_pirate.2.a: "We should investigate."
  
 mem_dread_pirate_chain_title: "Dread Pirate Raewynn"
 mem_dread_pirate_chain_desc: "Marauder legends tell about Dread Pirate Raewynn, the most fearsome pirate this galaxy has ever seen, and his immense treasures."
  
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_PROJECT: "Investigate the lead on the Dread Pirate"
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_PROJECT_DESC: "Otherwise an unremarkable [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon], §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! is rumoured to be the last resting place of the §SDread Pirate Raewynn§!. It might be worth a closer look."
  
 mem_dread_pirate.3.name: "Dread Pirate's Base"
 mem_dread_pirate.3.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports success in our search for the lair of the Dread Pirate Raewynn. A shielded bunker built into the cliffside of a tall mountain eluded our scans until now, but with the use of the marauder data, we now know better. \n\nIt seems that we weren't the first here. In fact, a rather gruesome sight awaited our team as they first arrived: the remains of large numbers of long-dead aliens, along with much of the equipment they had used, lie strewn across the site. It will take considerable effort to sift through both our precursors' work and the sprawling underground complex hidden on [the_planet.GetName]."
 mem_dread_pirate.3.a: "Establish the dig site."
  
 mem_dread_pirate_dig_site: "Dread Pirate's Grave"
 mem_dread_pirate_dig_site_desc: "A hidden complex on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is thought to be the resting place of the legendary Dread Pirate Raewynn. \n\nMany have ventured here before, but they seem to have left empty-handed or died inside."
 mem_dread_pirate.11.name: "The Antechamber"
 mem_dread_pirate.11.desc: "We have made our way deeper inside the underground complex on [From.Planet.GetName] and reached a large room that used to serve as a hangar or storage room of a sort. \n\nInside the room, multiple tents and archaeological equipment had been set up by the previous explorers, but no occupants or their remains have been found so far. [Leader.GetName] has located a datapad containing the following message: \n\n§S\"I am getting out of here. This is a warning for all that would come after Dread Pirate's treasure. You will find nothing here, only death and failure. More than a hundred of us have entered here and only a few remain. The rest have fallen victim to traps and their own greed. Nyrran, if you somehow survive and find this message, I hope suffering and misfortune will plague the rest of your miserable days.\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.12.name: "The Big Dig"
 mem_dread_pirate.12.desc: "Our archaeologists have successfully mapped out the upper layers of the underground complex on [From.Planet.GetName]. Multiple remains of several different species have been recovered alongside with their personal logs and belongings. \n\nIt seems several groups of explorers have travelled to this location in the past looking for the ill-gained treasure that Dread Pirate Raewynn amassed, including a legendary §Sceremonial mask§! he wore. This mask was a cultural icon among many marauder clans in the galaxy and whoever recovered it would command a lot of respect. \n\nTensions rose on the site as fantasies of wealth and fame clouded the archaeologists' minds until infighting broke out over control of the digging areas. Many were killed."
 mem_dread_pirate.13.name: "Cave In"
 mem_dread_pirate.13.desc: "[Leader.GetName] just came across a massive caved-in area in a remote section of the underground complex on [From.Planet.GetName]. It appears the section was shaken by a massive explosion with over a dozen of mangled dead bodies identifiable in a rubble. In a less affected section we have found a body with an intact datapad on it. The last entry reads as follows: \n\n§S\"Engineer Warres' log. Date: who cares. Nyrran fired me today. I told her that if we keep using high-power cutters in this area, we are going to hit a methane pocket nearby. She said I can leave if I don't believe in the mission. Just got back to the site to pack my stuff. Tried to talk some sense into Correl's team, but they all sided with Nyrran. They can blow themselves up without <<Speech recognition failure, noise too loud>> <<Unexpected end of recording>>\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.14.name: "The Dormitories"
 mem_dread_pirate.14.desc: "The archaeologists on [From.Planet.GetName] have found a series of rooms which they believe to be dormitories for Raewynn's crew. The crew is still here, dead and mummified in their beds. \n\nDue to the state of the bodies, it's impossible to be certain what killed them, but what is most weird about them is that the species they all belonged to is not known to us. Perhaps they were part of a now extinct marauder culture?"
 mem_dread_pirate.15.name: "The Excavation"
 mem_dread_pirate.15.desc: "Our archaeological expedition has found a massive network of tunnels below the main structure of the underground base on [From.Planet.GetName]. It seems Raewynn's forces spent considerable time looking for something in the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust, and some of the excavation equipment is still in evidence. Equipment of a different design, presumably placed by an archaeological expedition seeking for the Dread Pirate, is sparsely strewn across the tunnels. In an abandoned makeshift camp [Leader.GetName] has found another datapad. It contains only one message: \n\n§S\"Nyrran, I will not endanger myself and the crew by waiting for you here any longer. If you come back at any point, return to the base camp. I will leave behind enough supplies and one of the shuttles for you to get off this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], but you will not find me or anyone else. The course is pre-programmed to take you to the nearest civilized system where you will hopefully be arrested for your actions. Do not attempt to change it. It was a mistake to trust you. Good luck. Perhaps it's best if we never meet again.\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.16.name: "Nyrran's Fate"
 mem_dread_pirate.16.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has followed the tunnels to a massive empty chamber separate from the rest of the complex. Its design and technology seem very different to what Raewynn's forces were using at the time. A hatch can be found at the end of a long shaft that probably once led outside, but it seems to have collapsed as a result of tectonic activity at some point in the past. However, no sign of Raewynn or his treasures can be seen. The only interesting part of the room is the body on the floor wearing a suit with insignia identifying it as §YProfessor Nyrran§!, head of the expedition to find the dread pirate. She is still clutching a datapad. The last entry reads: \n\n§S\"Coming here was a mistake. Even if Raewynn was ever here, he's gone. The sacrifices I have made were for nothing. There's not enough oxygen left to make it to the surface, even if I wanted to, but the only thing waiting for me outside is arrest and trial for the sacrifices I had to make to get here. The deaths of all those idiots who killed each other or themselves to get ahead of me will be pinned on me. The rest of my crew is either dead or abandoned me. I will stay here and wait for death\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.16.a: "So the legend of the Dread Pirate was a lie?"
  
 mem_dread_pirate.23.name: "Pirate Flotilla"
 mem_dread_pirate.23.desc: "A contingent of pirate ships has entered system §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\nThey have postioned themselves on the outskirts of the system and do not appear to be hostile. Their flagship is hailing us."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.desc: "Greetings. It is I, §SDread Pirate Raewynn§!. \n\nIt has come to my attention that you ransacked my §Y\"Tomb\"§! on [the_planet.GetName]. As you can see, the rumours of my death are somewhat inaccurate, however I did have to leave some of my belongings down there. \n\nI would like to have my mask back, please. "
 mem_dread_pirate.24.a: "We didn't find your mask down there."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.a.response: "Is it so? I don't believe you. \n\nYou have ransacked my base quite thoroughly. Perhaps a little demonstration of firepower would teach you not to lie to people like this."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.b: "Your mask is ours now. (Lie)"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.b.response: "So, this is the way you choose to go? Perhaps a little demonstration of my power will make you change your mind."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.c: "What's in this mask to you?"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.c.response: "It holds great sentimental value, of course. But it's also a symbol of my power. \n\nWithout it, it's harder to rally forces to my cause."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.d: "You don't look like a dread pirate."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.d.response: "Why? I am [convo_portrait.Species.GetName]. Have you never encountered our war fleets?"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.e: "How are you alive after all those years?"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.e.response: "You'll be surprised what clean living and good eating habits can do to you."
 mem_dread_pirate.26.name: "Dread Pirate Flagship Destroyed"
 mem_dread_pirate.26.desc.1: "We have successfully taken down the flagship of the §SDread Pirate§! in §Y[combat_system.GetName]§!. He came to our territory seeking his mask, which means neither of us has it. \n\nWe should search the debris of the ship for more information - perhaps there could be other clues we missed."
 mem_dread_pirate.26.desc.2: "The Dread Pirate's flagship went down fighting the forces of the [ship_killer.GetName]. He came to our territory seeking his mask, which means neither of us has it. \n\nWe should search the debris of the ship for more information - perhaps there could be other clues we missed."

 mem_dread_pirate.27.name: "Not So Dread Pirate"
 mem_dread_pirate.27.desc: "We already suspected that the so-called \"Dread Pirate\" we encountered in [combat_system.GetName] was an imposter, and after studying what remains of his flagship we can confirm this. \n\nThe owner of that ship was merely a marauder warlord following a subspace signal originating from Raewynn's base on [the_planet.GetName] on a remote device that presumably once belonged to the real Dread Pirate. This is probably how he knew we visited the complex. \n\nWith this information, we were able to isolate a similar previously hidden subspace signal being transmitted from the complex. Perhaps it could point us to the Dread Pirate's real resting place?"
 mem_dread_pirate.27.a: "We should investigate."
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_TRIANGULATION_PROJECT: "Trace the Signal"
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_TRIANGULATION_PROJECT_DESC: "The complex on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! appears to still maintain subspace communications with an unknown object in another system. Knowing this, we might be able to uncover more of his history and perhaps even retrieve the legendary mask he wore."
 mem_dread_pirate.30.name: "Signal Trace Complete"
 mem_dread_pirate.30.desc: "[Leader.GetName] was able to successfully trace the signal originating from the complex on [the_planet.GetName]. It is being sent to an uncharted system nearby. \n\nIf there's any trace of Dread Pirate remaining in the galaxy, it's there."

 mem_dread_pirate.32.desc: "So, you have come to see the legendary Dread Pirate, have you? \n\nYou followed all the clues, pieced it all together. Did you expect some kind of treasure? Answers to some great question? \n\nI am not interested in dealing with you. I suggest you leave me alone."
 mem_dread_pirate.32.a: "Terminate the communication."
 mem_dread_pirate.32.b: "Are you the Dread Pirate?"
 mem_dread_pirate.32.b.response: "I was. This title is meaningless now. I have left it behind when I have lost my crew. My new companions don't care much for such titles. \n\nPerhaps you are here for my mask? There's no reason for me to wear it anymore, but I do not intend to surrender it either."
 mem_dread_pirate.32.c: "What happened on [the_planet.GetName]?"
 mem_dread_pirate.32.c.response: "A great treachery. Cowards didn't have the nerve to confront me directly, so they resorted to sabotage. Most of my crew died when life support went down. I was able to escape in the tunnels below. \n\nDo you want to know what I was looking for there? Look in front of you. This ship was hidden beneath my surface. They feared I would be unstoppable if I found it. They weren't wrong."
 mem_dread_pirate.32.d: "What is your ship exactly?"
 mem_dread_pirate.32.d.response: "I found it deep beneath the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. That was the reason why I chose that planet as my base. \n\nI don't know who made it, but it's... old. And it is alive. When I found it, it was abandoned, alone, waiting for purpose that nobody was around to give to it. I gave it that purpose. In return it made me part of it. Kept me alive. Kept me company when I was hidden away."
