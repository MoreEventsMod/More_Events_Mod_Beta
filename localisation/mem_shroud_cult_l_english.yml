 mem_shroud_cult.1.name: "First Contact with [mem_shroud_cult_country.GetName]"
 mem_shroud_cult.1.desc: "Ah, [Owner.GetSpeciesName]. How delightful. \n\nWe have been waiting for a while now for you to pay us a visit. We knew you would come eventually. \n\nSay, would you like to hear about the glorious Vortex, our saviour and protector in this trying times? You must be eager to have some guidance in your life. What, no? \n\nNo matter. You'll hear the word eventually. Perhaps once you learn about our amazing services, you would change your mind."
 mem_shroud_cult.1.machine: "Oh, it's you, [Owner.GetSpeciesName]. \n\nWe were watching you for a while, and I can't say we are that impressed by your existence as a thinking machine. Our faith is not geared towards someone like you. \n\nWe will let you pass through [From.GetName] unobsctructed, but we have no interest in trading with you in any capacity."
 mem_shroud_cult.1.hive: "Oh, it's you, [Owner.GetSpeciesName]. \n\nWe had high hopes for you, but it seems you are not quite what we imagined. I don't think you have any use of our faith, for it is geared towards being that are more... independent for the lack of better word. \n\nWe will let you pass through [From.GetName] unobsctructed, but we have no interest in trading with you in any capacity."

 mem_shroud_cult.3.name: "[the_cult_guys.GetName]"
 mem_should_cult.3.desc.0.1: "Ah, [Root.GetSpeciesName], delightful. Have you come seeking for spiritual wisdom? \nWe have such spritual wisdoms to show you. Of course, they come at a price. Price that may be monetary, but sometimes a simple gesture of good will also do. \n\nOur missionaries are itching to share the Vortean faith with your people, yet you are not willing to begin cooperation. Perhaps if you were to allow them travel through your territory, we could begin our trust-building excercises."
 mem_should_cult.3.desc.0.2: "Our missionaries are eagerly waiting to share our wisdom with your people, yet [Root.GetAdj] authorities do not seem to be willing to grant them entry. Until the situation changes, we can't talk about meaningful cooperation. We are terribly sorry."
 mem_should_cult.3.desc.1.1: "Greetins, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Are you tired of living life of ignorace yet? Our teaching is readily available for those who wish to learn."
 mem_should_cult.3.desc.1.2: "High Council of Vortean Magi would like to remind all visitors that apocalyptic visions you might experience in section 7G are a result of malfunctioning air filtration systems and are not legitimate divine revelations. \n\nThis does not change our stance on donation refunds. §RTHERE WILL BE NONE! NEVER EVER!§!"
 mem_shroud_cult.3.desc.cont: "Is there anything else you would like to discuss?"
 mem_shroud_cult.3.a: "We are willing to open our borders."
 mem_shroud_cult.3.a.tooltip: "Vortean missionaries will be permitted to travel through our territory spreading the teaching of the Vortex. What harm could it do?"
 mem_shroud_cult.3.b: "Your missionaries are no longer welcome."
 mem_shroud_cult.3.b.tooltip: "[the_cult_guys.GetName] will cease all activities in our territory. Their ongoing services will be cancelled, and their opinion of us will be reset."

 mem_shroud_cult.3.farewell: "Farewell."
 mem_shroud_cult.3.hams: "Why is there smoke coming out of you station?"
 mem_shroud_cult.3.hams.response: "Oh no. This isn't smoke. This is shroud energy. \n\nYou see, Pillar of Ethernity, our home station is partially submerged into a strange reality called "§BShroud§!". Nobody is quite sure what it is, but it is a realm where our master resides. So in order to divine the will of the Vortex better, we had to come a little bit closer. Do not worry. It's perfectly safe."

 mem_shroud_cult.3.xxx: "I want to cheat myself more opinion."
 mem_shroud_cult.3.xxx.response: "Shame on you!"

 mem_shroud_cult.4.desc: "Of course. We are always eager to share the wisdom of the Vortex. \n\nOf course, true enlightenment can only come through years of meditation, hard work and generous donations, but the quick rundown is free of charge."
 mem_shroud_cult.4.a: "Who or what is Vortex?"
 mem_shroud_cult.4.a.response: "Vortex is a being of immense power that resides in a realm of pure psionic energy, known as The Shroud. \n\nIs it ""§YWho§!" or "§YWhat§!"? That nobody can be certain of. Our top minds agree that it's a being on unfathomable complexity that defies our conventional concept of life, self-awareness or even existence itself. Shroud is weird like this."
 mem_shroud_cult.4.b: "What are the core principles of your faith?"
 mem_shroud_cult.4.b.response: "Hard work, spiritual hygiene, intellectual discipline, clean thoughts. \n\nThe exact practices require extensive learning however."
 mem_shroud_cult.4.c: "What is the history of your church?"
 mem_shroud_cult.4.c.response: "Most of our early history is lost in the mist of history. Our movement is very old, and was once spread across the galaxy. Now, we are mostly confined to our ancient starbase. \n\nOur sacred archives contain more information, but only the top ranked acolytes are permitted access to those."
 mem_shroud_cult.4.return: "We would like to discuss other matters."

 mem_shroud_cult.5.desc: "Mercy Corps is the most qualified medical organization in the known space, carefully selected out of the most talented and devout Vortean acolytes and trained in various xenomedican disciplines. \n\nTrained to work in all conditions, from a frontier clinic, to battlefield hospital, Mercy Corps will tend to your subjects needs, curing both physical and spiritual ailments. Of course, travel isn't free, so their services would require a donation. The more planets they have to expect to work on, the higher fee they would have to request. \n\nStandard service term is five years, can be renewed at your discretion."
 mem_shroud_cult.5.a: "Deal."
 mem_shroud_cult.5.b: "Not interested right now."

 mem_shroud_cult.6.desc: "The term of Mercy Corps contract is coming to an end. But our physicians are not eager to pack up and leave just yet. \n\nPerhaps you would be interested in renewing their services?"

 mem_shroud_cult.7.desc: "Our church has some of the highest standards of education indeed, especially in the realm of the psionic. \n\nHowever, it would not be easy to persuade one of them to leave their dusty old tomes behind and trade them for one of your fancy interfaces in the labs. A generous donation would help, though. Definitely."
 mem_shroud_cult.7.a: "We'd like to contract one."

 mem_shroud_cult.8.desc: "Our §YShroud Sermons§! are reserved for the most devout and the most faiithful. Each is carefully crafted to suit the needs of our followers by our best Magi. \n\nIt's not just an inspirational quote and maybe a cute picture attached to it. It's an inspirational quote and a cute picture infused by the most potent of spiritual energies! It can be used not just to inspire your subjects, but to supply them with tangible benefits. \n\nRemember that we can't tell you what it is until it's done, we can't produce more than one for you, and we will not accept it back. Are you interested?"

 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.life: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Life§!! \n\nMany people claim that life has no meaning and we are all just a random cosmic accident. We have compiled a list of eleven reasons why they are wrong. Number six will astound you!"
 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.joy: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Joy§!! \n\nHappiness after all is just a state of mind. Take sad moments in your life as a chance to learn. A famous saint once got blown to pieces after a oxygen tank accident, but he didn't complain and neither should you!"
 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.fortitude: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Fortitude§!! \n\nThe world is hard and unforgiving place. But even the most hostile environment can be endured with the right state of mind. There once was a scholar who walked onto a molten world to prove his theories. Everyone laughed at him, saying that he won't survive contact with lava and ash, but who's laughing now? Nobody does, molten worlds are no joke."
 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.knowledge: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Knowledge§!! \n\nIf only you knew how bad things really are, perhaps things wouldn't be so bad after all. Only in studying the creation we can uncover the sacred truth. And some other truths too, but they don't matter in the long game."
 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.labour: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Labour§!! \n\nIdle hands are playthings of all sorts of nasty things and that's why you should have none. Don't let your extremities be a plaything of anyone, and get back to work!"
 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.ingenuity: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Ingenuity§!! \n\nAny idiot can think and most idiots do; but how many can apply their thinking to something practical? Not many, that's how many. But doing so is the first step to any transformation of nature, and through transformation of nature, yourself."
 mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.prosperity: "$mem_shroud_cult.9.desc.common$ A §YSermon of Prosperity§!! \n\nHard work always yeilds the best rewards, as long as there's someone to reward you for it with the best reward.
