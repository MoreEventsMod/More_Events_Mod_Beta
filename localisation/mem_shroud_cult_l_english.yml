 mem_shroud_cult.1.name:0 "First Contact with [mem_shroud_cult_country.GetName]"
 mem_shroud_cult.1.desc:0 "Ah, [Owner.GetSpeciesName]. How delightful. \n\nWe have been waiting for a while now for you to pay us a visit. We knew you would come eventually. \n\nSay, would you like to hear about the glorious Vortex, our saviour and protector in this trying times? You must be eager to have some guidance in your life. What, no? \n\nNo matter. You'll hear the word eventually. Perhaps once you learn about our amazing services, you would change your mind."
 mem_shroud_cult.1.machine:0 "Oh, it's you, [Owner.GetSpeciesName]. \n\nWe were watching you for a while, and I can't say we are that impressed by your existence as a thinking machine. Our faith is not geared towards someone like you. \n\nWe will let you pass through [From.GetName] unobsctructed, but we have no interest in trading with you in any capacity."
 mem_shroud_cult.1.hive:0 "Oh, it's you, [Owner.GetSpeciesName]. \n\nWe had high hopes for you, but it seems you are not quite what we imagined. I don't think you have any use of our faith, for it is geared towards being that are more... independent for the lack of better word. \n\nWe will let you pass through [From.GetName] unobsctructed, but we have no interest in trading with you in any capacity."
 mem_shroud_cult.2.name:0 "[From.GetName]"
 mem_should_cult.2.desc.0:0 "Ah, [Root.GetSpeciesName], delightful. Have you come seeking for spiritual wisdom? \nWe have such spritual wisdoms to show you. Of course, they come at a price. Price that may be monetary, but a simple gesture of good will could do. \n\nOur missionaries are itching to share the Vortean faith with your people, yet you are not willing to begin cooperation. Perhaps if you were to allow them travel through your territory, we could begin our trust-building excercises."
 mem_should_cult.2.desc.1.1:0 "Greetins, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Are you tired of living life of ignorace yet? Our teaching is open-source, you can access it free of charge."
 mem_should_cult.2.desc.1.2:0 "High Council of Vortean Magi would like to remind all visitors that apocalyptic visions you might experience in section 7G are a result of malfunctioning air filtration systems and are not legitimate divine revelations. \n\nThis does not change our stance on donation refunds. §RTHERE WILL BE NONE! NEVER EVER!§!"
 mem_shroud_cult.2.a:0 "We are willing to open our borders."
 mem_shroud_cult.2.a.tooltip:0 "Vortean missionaries will be permitted to travel through our territory spreading the teaching of the Vortex. What harm could it do?"
 mem_shroud_cult.2.farewell:0 "Farewell."
 mem_shroud_cult.2.hams:0 "Why is there smoke coming out of you station?"
 mem_shroud_cult.2.hams.response:0 "Oh no. This isn't smoke. This is shroud energy. \n\nYou see, Pillar of Ethernity, our home station is partially submerged into a strange reality called "§BShroud§!". Nobody is quite sure what it is, but it is a realm where our master resides. So in order to divine the will of the vortex better, we had to come a little bit closer. Do not worry. It's perfectly safe."
