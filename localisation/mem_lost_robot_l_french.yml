# Initial Event
mem_lost_robot.1.name:0 "A Lost Robot"
 mem_lost_robot.1.desc:0 "Our administrators on [Root.GetName]'s moon's mining station are reporting that an 'AL' model robot is missing from the last shipment we sent them.\n\nThey ask us to investigate and send it to the moon so it can start its mining duty."
 mem_lost_robot.1.accept:0 "They must be mistaken. Check the delivery manifest."
 mem_lost_robot.1.deny:0 "It's a single missing robot. They will do without it."

# Retrieve the robot
mem_lost_robot.2.name:0 "A Lost Robot"
 mem_lost_robot.2.desc:0 "After checking the flight manifest and the receipt, it appears there's really a missing robot in the last shipment.\n\nWe see two options here. Either it has been left somewhere in the space cargo that was used to send it to the moon, or it never quit the planet and it is still somewhere in the factory that produced it."
 mem_lost_robot.2.cargo:0 "Check the space cargo hold."
 mem_lost_robot.2.factory:0 "Check the factory stocks."

# Check the cargo - Delayed
mem_lost_robot.10.name:0 "Nothing in the Cargo"
 mem_lost_robot.10.desc:0 "Unfortunately, the robot was not in the cargo ship. Even worse, we lost quite some time during this search as we had to wait for the cargo to return from another delivery.\n\nWe could now try to check the factory as we know it has never been on board the cargo ship."
 mem_lost_robot.10.factory:0 "Yes, look at the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.10.abandon:0 "It's not worth our time. Cancel the search."
 
# Check the cargo - Normal
mem_lost_robot.11.name:0 "Nothing in the Cargo"
 mem_lost_robot.11.desc.first:0 "Unfortunately, the robot was not in the cargo ship. We could now try to check the factory as we know it has never been on board the cargo ship."
 mem_lost_robot.11.desc.second:0 "Unfortunately, the robot was not in the cargo either. As a last resort, maybe we should try searching [Root.GetName]'s surface. If the robot somehow escaped, it might still be in the surroundings of the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.11.factory:0 "Yes, look at the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.11.planet:0 "Alright, look at the planet."
 mem_lost_robot.11.abandon:0 "It's not worth our time. Cancel the search."

# Check the factory
mem_lost_robot.20.name:0 "Nothing in the Factory"
 mem_lost_robot.20.desc.first:0 "After much time spent checking the factory on [Root.GetName], we are sure that the robot is not present there anymore. It is possible it has been forgotten in the space cargo, so maybe we should search there."
 mem_lost_robot.20.desc.second:0 "After much time spent checking the factory on [Root.GetName], we can be assured that the robot is not present there anymore. As a last resort, maybe we should try searching [Root.GetName]'s surface. If the robot somehow escaped, it might still be in the surroundings of the factory."
 mem_lost_robot.20.cargo:0 "Ok, investigate the cargo."
 mem_lost_robot.20.planet:0 "Good. Check the planet's surface."
 mem_lost_robot.20.abandon:0 "Stop wasting resources. Cancel the search."

# Robot retrieved 
mem_lost_robot.30.name:0 "Robot Retrieved"
 mem_lost_robot.30.desc.cargo:0 "After checking the cargo ship from top to bottom, we finally found the robot, which had got stuck in a janitor's room after it escaped the cargo hold. We will schedule it for some reprogramming before sending it to the moon."
 mem_lost_robot.30.desc.factory:0 "After a thorough search of the immense factory, we found the robot stuck under a conveyor belt. We don't know how it ended here nor why it left its place, but we will schedule it for some reprogramming before sending it to the moon."

# Disinto fired 
mem_lost_robot.101.name:0 "Tragedy"
 mem_lost_robot.101.desc:0 "We finally found the robot. Apparently, it fled from the factory before it could be loaded on the cargo ship that should have sent it to the moon. It then hid on [Root.GetName] and built the mining equipment, known as a Disinto, that it was supposed to make on the moon.\n\nUnfortunately, once activated, it created a massive crater, causing widespread destruction and killing most of the population in the surrounding area instantly. Judging by the size of the crater, the robot must have improved the initial Disinto's design to be able to deliver such power. The Disinto was destroyed by its activation and although the robot itself survived the shockwave, it lost its memory in the process, so we cannot retrieve the plan for this improved mining device."
 mem_lost_robot.101.a:0 "This is a tragedy."
 mem_lost_robot_101.tooltip:0 "A massive crater has been created on the planet's surface, killing all the surrounding population and destroying our installations."

# Robot found with broken disinto
mem_lost_robot.102.name:0 "Useless Find"
 mem_lost_robot.102.desc.luck:0 "Locals on [Root.GetName] have reported spotting a lonely robot in the wild. Following the reports, we have found the missing 'AL' model in a forest clearing. It had completely lost its mind and apparently was trying to build a mining device called a Disinto, which would have created a large crater in the planet's surface. Fortunately, we arrived in time to stop it from being activated, thus averting disaster."
 mem_lost_robot.102.desc:0 "After our extensive search, we finally found the robot. It was a malfunctioning unit that was trying to build a mining equipment called a Disinto on the planet, rather than the moon. If activated, the device would have created a large crater in the planet's surface. Fortunately, the device was as malfunctioning as its creator, so we avoided a potential tragedy."
 mem_lost_robot.102.a:0 "Scrap it for material."

# Robot found with working disinto
mem_lost_robot.103.name:0 "Lucky Find"
 mem_lost_robot.103.desc.luck:0 "Locals on [Root.GetName] have reported that they have spotted a lonely robot in the wild. Following the reports, we have found the missing 'AL' model in a forest clearing. We also found a Disinto, a mining device used on [Root.GetName]'s moon that the robot had been building.\n\nAfter close examination, it appears that the robot improved the Disinto's design to an extent we couldn't have imagined. Early estimates suggest that using this new design could help us increase our mineral production considerably."

 mem_lost_robot.103.a:0 "That will be really useful."
