  mem_red_echoes.2.desc:0 "Preliminary scans of [FromFrom.GetName] indicate a canyon with several openings throughout. We originally thought they may be dwellings for some or another type of wildlife, but we now are not so sure as one of Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] interns realised that they are spaced almost equidistantly apart from one another. Additionally, each one - though poorly constructed - is a square too similar to the others to be considered a natural construction.\n\nTwo probes sent down show a heavy door blocking a second entrance about 100 meters into each cave, very well preserved. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports unknown glyphs and runes in the caves leading to these entrances, lining the walls from floor to ceiling."

  mem_red_echoes.3.desc:0 "The expedition team began with four different archways located in the most accessible points within the canyon. The entrance was heavy, but not immobile. Following standard excavation procedures allowed the team to roll the first one aside. Though the other doors are proving a bit more stubborn, the team believes that a bit more prodding will eventually yield the intended result. Disturbingly, the team did find tell-tale triggers for several traps that are more likely than not still functional. We need to be extremely careful; some of these look quite nasty indeed.\n\nUpon entering the first room, the team discovered a tomb that is extremely dated, its construction assumed to have taken place near end of this culture’s stone age. It looks to be entirely untouched save for residual dust, various personal items, and several clay jars filled with the remnants of food. The team\'s first speculations are that these are the occupant’s intended supplies to help guide them into the afterlife. Translators working through the text on the rough stone sarcophagus in the center of the room have given us their initial work, and it reads: \"Forever rests Xulathun X, Shaman of the Red and the highest of highs.\"\n\nHowever, our techs discovered text in a different language located on the archway above and behind the tomb in clear view of the door. The text was remarkably easier to translate and simply read: §S\"You can go home.\"§! One of the techs suggested previous grave robbers trying to pull a joke, but if that’s the case, why didn’t they take anything?"

The escort has expressed a desire to be relieved and shipped to [mem_red_echoes_random_planet.GetName], which has been granted. Counseling will of course be provided."

  mem_red_echoes.5.desc:0 "Almost immediately upon gaining entry to the first tomb, the second doorway started to give way under our techniques and was soon easily rolled aside, revealing another door down a short hallway. This door was cast in mostly red marble with an inscription above in a language utterly divorced from that of the first tomb, the script more rigid and angled. Even a cursory examination made it apparent that the team was looking at two completely different cultures.\n\nThe team proceeded in opening this door with eventual success. The locks were robust, but not terribly difficult to figure out with some basic fiddling and a bit of ingenuity. Multiple team members reported hearing voices, though none of them appear to have heard the same set of phrases. None of these voices were recorded on any piece of equipment, though multiple team members had tried. Multiple traps were identified, most of them triggered by tripwire.\n\nThe electric lights that powered on upon entering the tomb were as surprising as the remarkably clean air readings. The sarcophagus within was itself encased in glass all the way around, allowing a clear view of the mummified corpse within: a mammalian creature similar in height to us, with neatly-groomed facial hair and wearing a rotted and - for such a revered leader - simple garment. The translators have finally worked out the script that is over the entrance to this tomb, which reads simply \"Lenin\". Additionaly, a plaque on the wall within the tomb reads \"Revolutioneer. Hero of the Supreme Soviet. Lover of the Red.\" Above the tomb itself was script in the same style as that of the cryptic message in Xulathun X’s tomb. This text simply reads: §S\"You can still go home.\"§!"

Upon further investigation, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the rest of the expedition team were found slaughtered, their corpses mangled and tossed about the tomb. A single fully-loaded firearm was found placed between their bodies as if to make some sort of statement. The ammunition canister was of a curved shape and its magazine fully-loaded.

He then picked up a hatchet and proceeded to hack the camp provisions officer to death in front of the officer\'s son, an intern student from the university on [mem_red_echoes_random_planet.GetName]. The officer’s son lunged at the consultant and promptly received the hatchet in his forehead for his trouble. The rabid consultant was finally subdued by the guards who, negligent in their duties, were taking a break away from their posts. The entire away team is troubled to say the least. The object the consultant was examining was revealed to be a small fossilized piece of jewelry, most likely a lapel: a small, shiny red pentagram."

[Root.Leader.GetSheHe] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] expedition team were greeted with an enormous wall of water! Following this surprising event, however, the team reports seeing clearly inside the door, revealing a room that seems to be somewhat larger than the last two. After a few hours of deliberation it was agreed that the team should proceed further within using diving equipment, an unexpected but quickly fulfilled request.\n\nAfter donning the equipment, the team entered the tomb. Everyone agreed that this one easily wins the award for the most beautiful thus far. A large stone sarcophagus lies against the northern wall, before which are two smaller stone sarcophagi and twelve still smaller ones arranged in neat rows that alternate directions so that if lines were drawn they would rest in a perpendicular grid. It would appear that each one was treated to grow algae and coral, and there are waterproofed sunlamps adorning the roof to help maintain bacterial and plant growth; the source of power for these has yet to be determined. The floor reveals an intricate pattern of twisted colorful branches and material that wind around and under each other in a beguiling intertwining of stalks. Many colors are present, but unsurprisingly red and its various shades are the dominant colors here. Still, the space is immaculately beautiful.\n\nAs with the previous tombs the team reports an inscription on the wall, the script inlaid with crimson bioluminescent microorganisms seemingly placed there to make the words glow. It reads: \"Sacrificed here for the Red is the Lifetime Archduke of the Oceans Glublureum of Saltsand and his wives and children. Given unto the Red for peace and fulfillment, loved by his supplicants, defeater of the prawn beasts.\" As before, the opposite wall is inscribed with the same script as the previous warnings, although this particular warning is different than the others. §S\"Next comes the bargain. You can still go home.\"§!\n\nSeveral minutes after their report detailing the inscription, a large sinkhole opened up in the middle of the dig site outside the tombs, taking a small bulldozer that was parked there with it. After returning from the tomb, the team was able to peer into the depths of the sinkhole. They report seeing a circular stone floor with what is supposedly some sort of handle or latch in the center of the floor. Spelunking would easily drop us down onto the surface."

The pincers were quite poisonous. After drawing back the team, security and medical personnel took a casualty report: 4 dead with 9 others heavily injured.
