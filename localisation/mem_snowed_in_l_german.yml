 mem_snowed_in_category:0 "Frozen Ruins"
 mem_snowed_in_category_desc:0 "As unlikely as it sounds, the frozen surface of §Y[Root.GetName]§! seems to have once supported life. What looks like the remains of a once thriving civilisation can still be seen on its surface."
 
 #Events
 
 mem_snowed_in.1.name:0 "Frozen Ruins"
 mem_snowed_in.1.desc:0 "Observation of §Y[From.GetName]§! confirms our initial hypothesis - there are ruins all over its frozen surface. Vast metropolitan areas can still be identified across different regions. \n\nPreliminary analysis suggests that the planet was once home to an industrial civilisation until a mysterious cataclysm caused the current ice age and turned the entire planet into an icy wasteland."
 
 mem_snowed_in.3.name:0 "Life in the Ice"
 mem_snowed_in.3.desc.first:0 "Our continuous monitoring of §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! has revealed something unexpected. \n\nIt appears that an energy source is still active deep beneath the planet's surface. Deeper probing from our research station has established that a number of survivors from the original cataclysm that caused the planet's current ice age still live deep underground."
 mem_snowed_in.3.desc.second:0 "It appears a group of survivors from the original cataclysm that turned §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! into a frozen wasteland still live deep beneath the surface. \n\nOur research station has pinpointed their underground habitat."
 mem_snowed_in.3.a:0 "Establish communications with them."
 mem_snowed_in.3.b:0 "Keep observing them."
 mem_snowed_in.3.c:0 "Survivors? Not for very long."
 mem_snowed_in.3.d:0 "Survivors? We should harvest them."
 mem_snowed_in.3.tooltip:0 "£society  §GSociety§! output on §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! will increase."
 
 mem_snowed_in.5.name:0 "Contact Established"
 mem_snowed_in.5.desc:0 "After intercepting sufficient data from within the underground habitat on §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§!, we were able to decode aliens' language and data protocols. \n\nWe are now ready to establish contact with bunker's residents."
 
 mem_snowed_in.6.name:0 "Communication with [mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]"
 mem_snowed_in.6.desc.first:0 "Greetings, I represent the provisional government of §Y[mem_snowed_in_species.GetSpeciesName] Civilisation§!... Well, what is left of it. \n\nAre you really a spacefaring civilisation? You probably can see that our own world is not in best shape. Perhaps there's a place for us on one of the planets in your mighty empire?"
 mem_snowed_in.6.desc.second:0 "Oh, you seem to be someone new. \n\nI don't know what happens up there, but I tell you what I told those who came before you. \n\nI represent the provisional government of §Y[mem_snowed_in_species.GetSpeciesName] Civilisation§!. You probably can see that our own world is not in best shape. Perhaps there's a place for us on one of the planets in your mighty empire?"
 mem_snowed_in.6.a:0 "What happened to your world?"
 mem_snowed_in.6.a.response:0 "Impossible to say for sure. When it started, our science was not advanced enough to fully understand... Now we practically don't have any science left. \n\nSomething, or perhaps even someone caused our planet's orbit to destabilise. It took it centuries to drift as far from the star as we are now, so we were able to adapt... but still, we are now trapped here, surrounded by almost absolute zero outside."
 mem_snowed_in.6.b:0 "This could be arranged."
 mem_snowed_in.6.b.tooltip:0 "Refugees from §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! will gradually move to our worlds, as long as we have enough habitable space."
 mem_snowed_in.6.c:0 "We can't take any of you in."
 mem_snowed_in.6.c.gestalt:0 "Individualists like you do not belong with us."
 mem_snowed_in.6.c.response:0 "I see. That's unfortunate. \n\nBut we made it this far, we'll find a way to survive without your help."
 mem_snowed_in.6.c.xenophobe:0 "Your species deserves extinction, [mem_snowed_in_species.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 mem_snowed_in.6.c.xenophobe.response:0 "I see. \n\nA simple "No" would have sufficed."
 mem_snowed_in.6.d:0 "We can provide you with technology to help you survive."
 mem_snowed_in.6.d.response:0 "Not exactly what we were hoping for... But it'll definitely help."
 mem_snowed_in.6.e:0 "We will pray for your salvation."
 mem_snowed_in.6.e.response:0 "Really?! Pray? \n\nSure, why not. Praying will definitely help us to not freeze to death."
 
 mem_snowed_in.7.name:0 "Orbital Bombardment Complete"
 mem_snowed_in.7.desc:0 "Our forces have successfully delivered a payload of depth charges on the surface of §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§!. The bunker has been successfully collapsed and whoever was hiding there has been eliminated."
 mem_snowed_in.7.tooltip:0 "£society  §GSociety§! output on §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! decreases significantly with the destruction of natives."
 
 mem_snowed_in.8.name:0 "Bunker Invasion Complete"
 mem_snowed_in.8.desc:0 "Our attack drones have made their way through the bunker beneath the surface of §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§!. With primitive resistance swiftly crushed, the bunker's residents have been successfully captured for our use."
 mem_snowed_in.8.a:0 "We feast."
 mem_snowed_in.8.b:0 "Assimilate their knowledge and dispose of them."
 mem_snowed_in.8.c:0 "Assimilate them and resettle them in a more habitable place."
 mem_snowed_in.8.c.tooltip:0 "Several £pop  pops will be brought onto our world as cyborgs."
 
 mem_snowed_in.9.name:0 "Evacuation Complete"
 mem_snowed_in.9.desc:0 "The last survivors from §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! have moved out to settle on our worlds. The planet is now completely empty."
 
 mem_snowed_in.999.name:0 "False Lead"
 mem_snowed_in.999.desc:0 "It appears our original assessment of §Y[fromfrom.GetName]§! was incorrect. \n\nThe planet is covered in peculiarly shaped jagged rocks, but is conspicuously devoid of artificial structures of any kind."
 mem_snowed_in.999.a:0 "Oh well..."

 MEM_SNOWED_IN_ESTABLISH_CONTACT_DESC:0 "The bunker beneath the surface of §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! appears to contain sapient life. We should be able to intercept and decipher their communications and learn their language."
 
 MEM_SNOWED_IN_DESTROY:0 "Destroy the Bunker"
 MEM_SNOWED_IN_DESTROY_DESC:0 "The bunker beneath the surface of §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! appears to contain sapient life. This must not be allowed to continue. \n\nWith a precise enough strike, we can collapse it with ease, exposing the residents to a combination of debris and near-absolute zero temperatures."
 
 MEM_SNOWED_IN_ASSAULT:0 "Capture the Bunker"
 MEM_SNOWED_IN_ASSAULT_DESC:0 "The bunker beneath the surface of §Y[mem_snowed_in_planet.GetName]§! appears to contain sapient life. With a small strike force, we should be able to capture them for further use."
