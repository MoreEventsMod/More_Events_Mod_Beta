 mem_catacombs_category_desc:0 "A thorough examination of the planet has found an entrance to a network of tunnels that extend within the planet, possibly built by someone before the planet was rendered uninhabitable."
  
 mem_catacombs.10.name:0 "The Collection"
 mem_catacombs.10.desc:0 "We have managed to explore nearly all of the caverns, and what we have found is unprecedented. \n\nWithin the various vaults and galleries, we have found hundreds of artefacts preserved within an inert atmosphere. The archive potentially contains materials covering hundreds of worlds and cultures, and tests have revealed that several of the artefacts are millions of years old. \n\nThis collection of priceless artefacts could be a boon to researchers studying cultures that have long since gone extinct. However, many collectors are also interested, and are willing to pay large sums for the collection."
 mem_catacombs.10.a:0 "No, we shall study it for ourselves."
 mem_catacombs.10.b:0 "Put a price on it."
 mem_catacombs.10.c:0 "Xeno filth cannot be allowed to contaminate us."
 
 mem_catacombs.11.name:0 "Natural Formations"
 mem_catacombs.11.desc:0 "What seemed upon first analysis to be an artificial network of subterranean caverns turned out to be nothing of the sort. The caves appear to go deep within the planet, however they offer nothing of value that cannot be found elsewhere under less dangerous conditions."
 mem_catacombs.11.a:0 "Too bad."
  
 mem_catacombs.12.name:0 "Collapse"
 mem_catacombs.12.desc:0 "In the process of exploring the caverns, a gallery collapsed on top of §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! and the team, killing them instantly. A number of researchers were also trapped in the rubble for several days, and nearly all of the artefacts were destroyed either by the collapse or the subsequent search effort. Nothing of value was recovered from the site."
