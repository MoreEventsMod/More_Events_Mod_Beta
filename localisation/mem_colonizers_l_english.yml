 mem_colonizers.1.name: "Warning Signal"
 mem_colonizers.1.desc: "[Root.GetName] picked up an unusual signal in [From.GetName] System. It appears to be a warning broadcast activated when the ship emerged from hyperspace, probably tripping some kind of automatic system."
 MEM_COLONIZERS_HEADER: "Confederacy of the Endless Sea"
 mem_colonizers.2.desc: "Attention, unidentified native force. You are approaching territory of the §SConfederacy of the Endless Sea§!. \n\nThe confederate territory in this galaxy is off-limit for Native ships. Any vessel attempting to traverse our systems may and will be fired upon. Thank you for your cooperation."
 mem_colonizers.2.a: "Greetings."
 mem_colonizers.2.b: "You'll change your mind when you know us better."
 mem_colonizers.2.c: "Do not presume to threaten us without consequences."
 mem_colonizers.2.d: "$SCUM$"
 mem_colonizers.2.e: "The prey smells funny..."
 mem_colonizers.2.f: "Are you organic? You sound organic."
 mem_colonizers.4.desc.1: "Get on with it, naitve. We don't have all day."
 mem_colonizers.4.desc.2: "We are listening to you, native. For now, anyway."
 mem_colonizers.4.desc.3: "Speak, native. Don't waste what precious little time we have."
 mem_colonizers.4.desc.4: "Loud and clear, native. What do you want?"
 mem_colonizers.4.a: "This is all for now."
 mem_colonizers.4.b.1: "Are you interested in trade?"
 mem_colonizers.4.b.2: "We'd like to offer a tribute."
 mem_colonizers.4.c: "We'd like to call in some favors."
 mem_colonizers.4.d: "Why do you call us \"natives\"?"
 mem_colonizers.4.d.response: "Simple. You are natives because your species originated in this galaxy. We did not. \n\nOur home galaxy is connected to your with a highly advanced gateway technology. What you can see is but a small outpost of our glorious empire. No, you aren't allowed to see the rest of it."
 mem_colonizers.4.e: "What is \"Endless Sea\"?"
 mem_colonizers.4.e.response: "It's a sea. That is endless. \n\nIt is as endless as we are. It's all very poetic, perhaps too poetic for your tiny mind. Or perhaps you just lack necessary frame of reference to appreciate the poetry. Probably the former."
 mem_colonizers.4.f: "Why don't you transmit your actual face?"
 mem_colonizers.4.f.response: "The same reason why you ask idiotic questions. Because we choose so. \n\nWe don't think you need to see us. "
 mem_colonizers.5.desc.1: "We do not do §Y\"Trade\"§!. Not with the likes of you, anyway. \n\nWe are willing to accept §Stribute§! if you are into this sorts of things. We don't §Sneed§! tribute, but we aren't going to turn you down, as long as our traffic networks can take it. \n\nUnderstand, that we don't have any use for food or consumer goods that are popular in your galaxy, and energy just isn't easily transferrable through the gateway. We have some use for raw minerals, and at times some of the refined industrial produce. \n\nShip them out and we'll take notice. Perhaps eventually we will do you a favour in return. With a heavily emphasis on eventually. So, are you going to send anything?"
 mem_colonizers.5.desc.2: "Alright, what will it be?"
 mem_colonizers.5.a: "Let's talk about something else."
 mem_colonizers.5.z: "$mem_colonizers.4.a$"
 mem_colonizers.6.desc: "Alright, let's see what we have for you. Don't get your hopes high."
 mem_colonizers.6.a: "$mem_colonizers.5.a$"
 mem_colonizers.6.z: "$mem_colonizers.4.a$"
