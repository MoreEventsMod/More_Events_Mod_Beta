 mem_charmak.1.name: "The Charmak"
 mem_charmal.1.desc: "The interior of the ship is littered with mummified dead bodies. Some bodies bear signs of violent death, but most seem to have perished from starvation and life support failure. All of them belong to a species of small but resilient and physically adept avian species that called themselves the §SCharmak§! and was active in this region of the galaxy about 800 years ago. \n\nTheir physiology shows signs of spaceborne adaptation, suggesting that they have abandoned planetside habitation at some point in their past to live aboard spacecrafts such as this one."
 mem_charmak.2.name: "The Charmak Horde"
 mem_charmak.2.desc: "Further study of the ship found on [From.Planet.GetName] and various artefacts aboard has granted us more insights into the §SCharmak§! society. \n\nThe Charmak organized their clan-based society primarily based on physical strength and martial prowess. The strong would violently coerce their weaker brethren to follow their orders, while fighting one another for the dominance. The strongest of them would be called a §YCharmakar§! and serve as a leader of a clan. \n\nThe life of Charmak was short and brutal, but for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with them, it was much worse. They were a society of planet looters, attacking planetside settlements with reckless disregard for personal safety, killing and pillaging everything they came across. \n\nVery few of their activities didn't revolve around this never-ending looting - most of those not involved in combat would work on manufacturing and designing new weapons; the select few who lived to become too injured or infirm to fight or work would find employment creating art to inspire their comrades to pillage harder or cataloguing trophies gained in the recent raids."
 mem_charmak.3.name: "The Charmakarade"
 mem_charmak.3.desc: "The purpose of the ship found in orbit above [From.Planet.GetName] has become clearer. The vessel was a flagship of one of the most prominent and prosperous clans in the Charmak horde and a site of regular meetings of Charmakars from all over the horde known as §SThe Charmakarade§!. \n\nThe clans were mostly insular, but occasionally they had to gather together to establish alliances, coordinate attacks or address other concerns of the entire horde. On average, a Charmakarade ended with 53% of the Charmakars in agreement and other 47% dead."
 mem_charmak.4.name: "The Orange Freaks"
 mem_charmak.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports finding records from the last Charmakarade ever held on a ship [Leader.GetSheHe] is studying. It took place not long before the collapse of Charmak civilisation. \n\nThe only item on the agenda was a new foe the horde had encountered - the Charmaks did not care to learn their identity, referring to them simply as §SOrange Freaks§!. They had conducted a series of hit-and-run attacks on smaller, more isolated clans in the horde, which for the Charmak was something unheard of - and finding themselves on the receiving end of the attacks for once was a cause of great concern. \n\nMany Charmakars pledged their clan's support to the retaliation campaign."
 mem_charmak.5.name: "Fatal Ruminations"
 mem_charmak.5.desc: "The records of the last years of the Charmak society are scarce, but §Y[Leader.GetName]§! now believes that [Leader.GetSheHe] can reconstruct their downfall. \n\nThe Charmak campaign was successful and the entire civilisation of the §SOrange Freaks§! was wiped out as a result. Large numbers of Charmak who were captured in the initial raids were found, liberated and publicly shamed for their weakness, however something strange happened afterwards. \n\nIt appears their captors were trying to turn their prisoners to their side and in doing so discussed in great detail their social and political differences. The captives then passed what they learned on to the rest of the Charmak. \n\nNever before had the Charmak bothered to study the structure of the societies they terrorized, and while revelation that it's possible to select one's leaders based on something other than their capacity for violence did not impress them at first, it had a profound effect on their psyche in the long run. The more their thought about this, the more it caused them to doubt the Charmak ways, eventually driving them to compulsive insubordination or deep melancholy, where they would simply refuse to follow orders, even when threatened with death, and ultimately refused to eat, drink and maintain their ships. \n\nWithin a decade, their entire society had collapsed and their once fearsome species became extinct. Their flagship, the §YCharmakaradum§!, remains however, and we can restore it back to working condition."
