 mem_events.300:0 "Space Odyssey"
 mem_events.300.desc:0 "Our sensors have picked up something most unusual, even by our standards. The [From.GetName] system appears to have four large "obelisk" type structures centered around the local star that looks most intruiging. We can't discern any energy signals from the objects, but the shielded world in the system might have some answers."
 mem_events.300.a:0 "This system merits our attention."
 
 mem_events.301:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_events.301.desc:0 "Commander, we believe we have discovered a way to interface with the orbital structures in the [Root.System.GetName] system. Our Scientists reckon we can alter the devices found on [Root.GetName] in a way that will allow us to directly interface. It would provide an excellent opportunity to investigate this technology and who knows what rewards we could discover."
 mem_events.301.a:0 "Give the order, interface with the device."
 mem_events.301.b:0 "What usually happens when we mess with ancient devices?"
 
 mem_events.302:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_events.302.desc:0 "Our preliminary testing and experimentation has proved very lucrative altogether! A slight increase in power would enable us to exponentially increase output, our scientists assure us the risks are minimal as fully powering the second interface would be a gargantuan task."
 mem_events.302.a:0 "Sounds good, you can have your resources."
 mem_events.302.b:0 "Be happy with what you have, no further interfacing."
 
 mem_events.303:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_events.303.desc:0 "The effects have been.. remarkable as I'm sure you have experienced. By increasing power to the obelisks on [Root.GetName] we can create a subspace link to our other worlds. We still believe we're at roughly 50% from being fully operational, the potential these objects must hold is staggering."
 mem_events.303.a:0 "Do it but remain vigilant, make sure we can shut the signal down."
 mem_events.303.b:0 "No, this project will remain isolated."
 
 mem_events.304:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_events.304.desc:0 "Rumors have spread that our population on [Root.GetName] have begun worshipping the ruins, they believe the obelisks are here to usher in a new era of prosperity and our security forces are reporting an increasingly volatile situation. They are demanding to fully power the obelisks."
 mem_events.304.a:0 "And they are right to do so. 100% power."
 mem_events.304.b:0 "What a mess. Let's end this."
 
 mem_events.305:0 "Contact"
 mem_events.305.desc:0 "Our scientists have established contact with the first obelisk, it should be ready for use."
 mem_events.305.a:0 "Excellent."

 mem_events.309.desc:0 "We have successfully interfaced with one of the orbital structures, we should experience some results shortly!"
 mem_events.309.a:0 "Excellent news, monitor progress carefully!"
 
 mem_events.310:0 "The Conduit"
 mem_events.310.desc:0 "Contact with the second orbital structure has been established! The output appears to have increased in line with our calculations, a remarkable achievement!"
 mem_events.310.a:0 "I have the utmost confidence in our science teams."
 
 mem_events.311:0 "The Conduit"
 mem_events.311.desc:0 "Handshake with the third orbital structure was a success! We have greatly magnified the output. No "major" side effects are being detected. We appear to have slightly underestimated the effects however."
 mem_events.311.a:0 "Brilliant."
 
 mem_events.312:0 "The Conduit"
 mem_events.312.desc:0 "Final orbital structure is online, the obelisks have been fully powered. It is taking all our resources to keep a track of our system. We believe we are up to the challenge and so far our fail-safe protocols are working."
 mem_events.312.a:0 "I hope we did the right thing."
 
 mem_events.313:0 "Watcher in the Sky"
 mem_events.313.desc:0 "We've detected a rather strange object in orbit above [mem_garden_star_locator.GetName]. Our sensors can't make sense of the readings."
 mem_events.313.a:0 "This is worrying."
 
 mem_events.314:0 "Dying Lights"
 mem_events.314.desc:0 "We appear to have lost contact with the [mem_conduit_system.GetName] system."
 mem_events.314.a:0 "What the hell is going on?"
 
 mem_events.319:0 "A New Dawn"
 mem_events.319.desc:0 "With the defeat of the alien command vessel, the otherworldy incursion has been stopped, and the obelisks shut down for good. The population is demoralized and dismayed, many driven to insanity by the presence of the invaders, with several splinter groups still under the aliens lingering influence. It will take time and care to restore the peoples morale. Yet many questions remain unanswered, just what was the purpose of this invasion?"
 mem_events.319.a:0 "We can contemplate this later, send humanitarian aid to the surface!"
 
 mem_events.320:0 "Magma Diver"
 mem_events.320.desc:0 "We are getting strange readings from one of the planets in the [mem_conduit_system.GetName] system. Something seems to be submerged in the fiery depths of [mem_garden_molten.GetName]."
 mem_events.320.a:0 "Send one of our construction ships to extract the object."
 mem_events.320.b:0 "Leave it be, we already had enough trouble in this system."
 
 mem_events.321:0 "The Littlest Leviathan"
 mem_events.321.desc:0 "The object we salvaged seems to belong to the alien civilization previously encountered in this system. It seems to resemble a core component of an advanced weapon platform. Based on our previous experience with this type of technology, we should take great precautions before attempting to integrate this into the fleet."
 mem_events.321.a:0 "It looks harmless enough."
 mem_events.321.b:0 "Take it apart before anyone gets another smart idea."
 
 mem_events.322:0 "Into the Vortex"
 mem_events.322.desc:0 "Our scientists believe that the ship is now fully operational and ready for deployment, we should be able to use it's full capabilities under combat conditions."

 mem_events.326:0 "From the Ashes"
 mem_events.326.desc:0 "Our weaponry appears to be inneffective on the target. Having sustained heavy losses we should turn to a more tactical approach and attempt to devise a way to surpass the enemies defenses."
 mem_events.326.a:0 "We aren't so easily beaten."
 mem_events.326.b:0 "We have no need for this."

 mem_events.327:0 "Law of Talion"
 mem_events.327.desc:0 "Our scientists believe they have devised a way to counteract the defenses that proved impenetrable for our forces on our last encounter. We should assemble our forces and engage the enemy immediately."
 mem_events.327.a:0 "Victory shall be ours!"
 
 mem_events.329:0 "Broken Pillars"
 mem_events.329.desc:0 "The four obelisks on the surface of the ancient garden world are no more."
 mem_events.329.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 mem_events.330:0 "The Eternal Flotilla"
 mem_events.330.desc:0 "With our new-found knowledge of the invaders technology, thanks to the ship we salvaged from the molten world in the system, we might be able to repair some of the wreckage in orbit of the ancient garden world. Choose wisely, we do not fully grasp their techbase yet and have only a limited supply of functional components for this project."
 mem_events.330.a:0 "We will repair a squadron of escort ships."
 mem_events.330.a.tooltip:0 "Repair 10 escort ships. §YCan only be constructed once.§!"
