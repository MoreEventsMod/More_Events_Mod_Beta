 mem_shieldcursors.2.name: "Shielded World"
 mem_shieldcursors.2.desc: "The planet [From.GetName] is protected by some kind of force field. \n\nOur scanners are not able to penetrate it and we don't have any means to bring the shield down. Perhaps exploring nearby systems could shed some light on this."

 mem_shieldcursors.100.name: "Abandoned Ship"
 mem_shieldcursors.100.desc: "We have detected an abandoned ship in stable orbit above [From.GetName]. The ship is badly damaged, but it's not clear whenever it was the reason for its abandoning or did it come later. \n\nArchaeological site can be established to further investigate it." 
 mem_shieldcursors.100.a: "Make it so."
 mem_shieldcursors.100.b: "Destroy the ship."
 mem_shieldcursors.100.b.tooltip: "A simple nudge and the vessel will spiral into the planet, destroyed forever. We will never uncover its secrets. Nor will anyone else."
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_1: "Abandoned Ship"
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_1_desc: "A small ship was parked in orbit above [From.Planet.GetName] and abandoned for reasons unknown. It would be prudent to board it and investigate its secrets."
 mem_shieldcursors.101.name: "Smuggler Ship"
 mem_shieldcursors.101.desc: "The first reports from the boarding party over [From.Planet.GetName] are coming through. Due to age of the ship, it required a lot of care to stabilize it and so far we still do not have access to all of the systems. \n\nThe ship appears to be built for stealth and evasion, and unarmed. It was designed to be operated by a small crew and carry large amount of cargo suggesting it was used for smuggling various goods without notice from local authorities."
 mem_shieldcursors.102.name: "Organic Holds"
 mem_shieldcursors.102.desc: "The boarding party lead by [Leader.GetName] has gained access and explored cargo holds of the smuggling ship parked above [From.Planet.GetName]. Beside mundane smuggled goods like weapons and unmarked medicine and some that can't be easily identified they have discovered something unexpected. \n\nThe ship contained several particularly hidden compartments, for the most valuable contraband. Those holds are filled with small stasis units. The units have long since failed and their content eroded away, but the traces are still identifiably organic in nature. It's impossible to tell whenever those were living specimen, foodstuff, organs for transplantation or something else entirely, but whatever it was, it was clearly the most prized possession of the crew. Each container is marked in code that we are yet to crack."
 mem_shieldcursors.103.name: "Brain Smuggling"
 mem_shieldcursors.103.desc: "Examination of logs aboard the ship revealed important information. It appears the ship's precious cargo was brain tissue. \n\nThe samples were carefully packaged and catalogued with each record containing some information about the donor. It is not entirely clear what value did this tissue had for the crew though."
 mem_shieldcursors.104.name: "Space Charts"
 mem_shieldcursors.104.desc: "Most of the data aboard the ship was purged when the crew abandoned it, but they weren't as thorough as they should have, allowing us to gain some insight in their operation. \n\nThe ship was operated illegally and primarily for the purpose of brain smuggling. The rest of the cargo were merely decoys. \n\nThe ship has ran into a patrol and escaped damaged, eventually forcing the crew to park the ship in uncharted system and use escape pods to flee. Their pursuers never recovered it. \n\nAlthough the purpose of the brain smuggling operation is still not entirely clear, we were able to gain some navigational data, one planet in particular seeming important."
 mem_shieldcursors.104.a: "Let's follow the coordinates."
 MEM_SHIELDCURSORS_BRAIN_DRAIN_COLONY: "Investigate Smugglers' Destination."
 MEM_SHIELDCURSORS_BRAIN_DRAIN_COLONY_DESC: "Data from the smuggler ship we found on [ship_planet.GetName] has led us to [target_planet.GetName]. We have reason to believe there's a settlement hidden somewhere on the planet."
 mem_shieldcursors.110.name: "Subterranean Ruins"
 mem_shieldcursors.110.desc: "We have followed coordinates recovered from the brain-smuggling shop and found a network of tunnels deep beneath the surface of [target_planet.GetName]. The network is big enough to house thousands of residents, but currently they are empty. No life signs detected anywhere on the planet. \n\nArchaeological site is established to further investigate the ruins."
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_2: "Subterranean Ruins"
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_2_desc: "A network of tunnels and an underground city. Once it was full of life but now everyone's gone. What happened here?"
 mem_shieldcursors.111.name: "Girb Commune"
 mem_shieldcursors.111.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports first findings from the ruins of subterranean city on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nThe [From.Planet.GetPlanetName] was once an otlying colony of the §SGirb§! a burrowing, arthopoid species that inhabited this region of the galaxy some time ago. As they expanded, they built tunnels underground, even, at times, on inhospitable worlds such as this and move in, expanding outwards searching for mineral deposits, geothermal veins or new habitations. \n\nThe smuggling ship we studied earlier shares all the markings of the Girb technology as well, clearly indicating that it was built and operated by the same species."
 mem_shieldcursors.112.name: "Brain Cartels"
 mem_shieldcursors.112.desc: "Due to chaotic nature of Girb society, central authorities would easily lose track of entire colonies, who were difficult to detect due to their subterranean nature. Unsurprisingly, illegal activities such as trading in prohibited goods flourished on many worlds, such as [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nWhat was unusual, however, is the nature of the trade, owing to the unique Girb neurophysiology. Their segmented brains were actually capable of assimilating transplanted foreign tissue without triggering an immune reaction. More so, the recepient would gain access to memories and skills stored on a slice of brain they were implanted with. \n\nThe removal of the brain tissue however, was highly damaging and thus practice of it was heavily regulated. While courts would extract memories from the convicted criminals to verify their guilt, and intelligence agencies would sometimes engage in brain theft, for general public the practice was forbidden under the pain of death. \n\nThis didn't stop illegal trade however, and on the colonies such as [From.Planet.GetName] Grib criminal §S\"Brain Cartels\"§! would slice heads open and sell memories for a small fortune. The smuggling ship that lead us here belong to one of the cartels."
 mem_shieldcursors.113.name: "Further Findings"
 mem_shieldcursors.113.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has finalized key discoveries on the Grib ruins. Though it's not clear what caused the downfall of the colony, [Leader.GetSheHe] managed to find some astrographical data. \n\nAmong it, Girb homeworld can be clearly identified."
 mem_shieldcursors.113.a: "We should investigate."
 MEM_SHIELDCURSORS_GIRB_HOMEWORLD: "Girb Homeworld"
 MEM_SHIELDCURSORS_GIRB_HOMEWORLD_DESC: "[girb_homeworld.GetName] is the homeworld of Girb, the brain-stealing creatures whose colony we investigated. \n\nWe should scan thoroughly for subterranean cities."
 mem_shieldcursors.120.name: "Girb Homeworld"
 mem_shieldcursors.120.desc: "Our assumptions were correct. [girb_homeworld.GetName] is indeed the homeworld of the Girb. \n\nWith a properly calibrated scanners, we were able to clearly see multitude of subterranean cities stretching across the planet's surface. \n\nThe planet itself definitely knew better days. Someone had thorougly destroyed the surface of the planet. Did they try to get to the Girb? Did they succeed?"
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_3: "Girb Homeworld"
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_3_desc: "Devastated surface of the planet still conceals sprawling cities of the Girb. This was their homeworld and this seemingly was their grave. \n\nBut who destroyed them and why?"
 mem_shieldcursors.121.name: "The Uplifted Species"
 mem_shieldcursors.121.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports first major findings on the Girb Homeworld. Unsurprisingly, the Girb's neural assimilation abilities were not a result of natural evolution. Rather, they were uplifted by some unknown alien race. \n\nThe Girb themselves were well aware of it and dedicated considerable effort trying to find out who has interfered in their evolution. However, no trace could be found."
 mem_shieldcursors.122.name: "The Uplifter War"
 mem_shieldcursors.122.desc: "It seems that the questions Girb asked themselves were eventually answered. The answer however was not what they hoped. \n\nThe species has uplifted them has returned but instead of happy reunions they've chosen to attack their former creation. The Girb fought a losing war, and were eventually destroyed by the more advanced empire despite their superior numbers."
 mem_shieldcursors.123.name: "Cracking the Shield"
 mem_shieldcursors.123.desc: "The destruction of the Girb was thorough, but not enough to fully cover tracks of their uplifters. \n\nThe Girb were able to deduce that the invasion was originating from a single planet, protected by an impenetrable shield in the nearby §Y[shielded_planet.Solar_System.GetName]§!. The Girb military was able to find a way to bypass the shield just as the invaders took orbit over their homeworld. Their secret bunkers still hold the necessary information, though the Girb never had a chance to use it. We, however, might."
 mem_shiedcursors.123.a: "Make necessary preparations."
 MEM_SHIELDCURSORS_DROP_SHIELD: "Unshielding the Planet"
 MEM_SHIELDCURSORS_DROP_SHIELD_DESC: "We now know enough to break through the shield protecting §Y[shielded_planet.GetName]§!. What secrets will we find there?"
 mem_shieldcursors.130.name: "The Uplifter's Fall"
 mem_shieldcursors.130.desc: "It seems we are not the first one to make it past the shield. It was not disabled before, but someone found a way past it. The cities on the planet still hold signs of bombardment. Little signs of resistance however. \n\nA recorded message is being broadcast over the world: \n\n§S\"They were cunning but we saw through their plans. We knew they have gave us life, and to countless others to harvest our minds at their prime. But they succeeded too much. We found them while they were sleeping. We have avenged those who came before us.\"§! \n\nThe resident of [shielded_planet.GetName] have repeatedly uplifted species across the galaxy and modified them to share their own brain-absorption abilities. As their creation advanced, they have hibernated in the safety of the shielded world until the time of harvest. Why did they do this is a mystery - perhaps they could only enjoy life when experienced by someone else. Perhaps it was something else. \n\nTheir harvest ships were destroyed in the dry docks, but one was spared and can be of use to us."
 mem_shieldcursors.130.a: "A lesson in hubris."
