 mem_shieldcursors.2.name: "Shielded World"
 mem_shieldcursors.2.desc: "The planet [From.GetName] is protected by some kind of force field. \n\nOur scanners are not able to penetrate it and we don't have any means to bring the shield down. Perhaps exploring nearby systems could shed some light on this."

 mem_shieldcursors.100.name: "Abandoned Ship"
 mem_shieldcursors.100.desc: "We have detected an abandoned ship in stable orbit above [From.GetName]. The ship is badly damaged, but it's not clear whenever it was the reason for its abandoning or did it come later. \n\nArchaeological site can be established to further investigate it." 
 mem_shieldcursors.100.a: "Make it so."
 mem_shieldcursors.100.b: "Destroy the ship."
 mem_shieldcursors.100.b.tooltip: "A simple nudge and the vessel will spiral into the planet, destroyed forever. We will never uncover its secrets. Nor will anyone else."
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_1: "Abandoned Ship"
 mem_shieldcursors_brain_drain_site_1_desc: "A small ship was parked in orbit above [From.Planet.GetName] and abandoned for reasons unknown. It would be prudent to board it and investigate its secrets."
 mem_shieldcursors.101.name: "Smuggler Ship"
 mem_shieldcursors.101.desc: "The first reports from the boarding party over [From.Planet.GetName] are coming through. Due to age of the ship, it required a lot of care to stabilize it and so far we still do not have access to all of the systems. \n\nThe ship appears to be built for stealth and evasion, and unarmed. It was designed to be operated by a small crew and carry large amount of cargo suggesting it was used for smuggling various goods without notice from local authorities."
 mem_shieldcursors.102.name: "Organic Holds"
 mem_shieldcursors.102.desc: "The boarding party lead by [Leader.GetName] has gained access and explored cargo holds of the smuggling ship parked above [From.Planet.GetName]. Beside mundane smuggled goods like weapons and unmarked medicine and some that can't be easily identified they have discovered something unexpected. \n\nThe ship contained several particularly hidden compartments, for the most valuable contraband. Those holds are filled with small stasis units. The units have long since failed and their content eroded away, but the traces are still identifiably organic in nature. It's impossible to tell whenever those were living specimen, foodstuff, organs for transplantation or something else entirely, but whatever it was, it was clearly the most prized possession of the crew. Each container is marked in code that we are yet to crack."
 mem_shieldcursors.103.name: "Brain Smuggling"
 mem_shieldcursors.103.desc: "Examination of logs aboard the ship revealed important information. It appears the ship's precious cargo was brain tissue. \n\nThe samples were carefully packaged and catalogued with each record containing some information about the donor. It is not entirely clear what value did this tissue had for the crew though."
 mem_shieldcursors.104.name: "Space Charts"
 mem_shieldcursors.104.desc: "Most of the data aboard the ship was purged when the crew abandoned it, but they weren't as thorough as they should have, allowing us to gain some insight in their operation. \n\nThe ship was operated illegally and primarily for the purpose of brain smuggling. The rest of the cargo were merely decoys. \n\nThe ship has ran into a patrol and escaped damaged, eventually forcing the crew to park the ship in uncharted system and use escape pods to flee. Their pursuers never recovered it. \n\nAlthough the purpose of the brain smuggling operation is still not entirely clear, we were able to gain some navigational data, one planet in particular seeming important."
