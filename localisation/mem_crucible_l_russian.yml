 mem_crucible.3.name:0 "Gripped by Insanity"
 mem_crucible.3.desc:0 "The population of [From.GetName] appears to have been affected by some kind of collective insanity. \n\nReports from our observation outpost indicate rioting on the streets and widespread chanting of nonsensical mantras. The small fraction of natives who have maintained their cognitive abilities are fleeing population centers, and their numbers are rapidly dwindling. The [From.Owner.GetName] is on the brink of complete collapse."
 mem_crucible.3.a:0 "Troubling."

 mem_crucible.4.name:0 "Shrouding"
 mem_crucible.4.desc.first:0 "We are observing strange phenomena on [From.GetName]. \n\n$mem_crucible.4.common$"
 mem_crucible.4.desc.latter:0 "Once again, planet [From.GetName] appears to be shrouded. \n\n$mem_crucible.4.common$"
 mem_crucible.4.common:0 "Some kind of fog has engulfed the surface of the madness-filled planet, as if the population itself had dissolved into it. \n\nIt is unclear what exactly has happened as no sensor can penetrate the fog."
 mem_crucible.4.a:0 "Very strange."

 mem_crucible.5.name:0 "Rebirth of the [mem_crucible_country.GetName]"
 mem_crucible.5.desc.never_seen_death:0 "The previously shrouded planet [From.GetName] appears to have undergone dramatic change. \n\nThe previously impenetrable fog has parted, revealing a civilization of sapient stone-age level populating its surface."
 mem_crucible.5.desc.seen_death:0 "[From.GetName], which we previously saw suddenly becoming shrouded, appears to have reversed this change. \n\nThe previously impenetrable fog has parted, revealing that the [mem_crucible_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] appear to have regressed into the stone age."
 mem_crucible.5.desc.seen_many_deaths:0 "Like before, the shrouding of [From.GetName] has been reversed. The previously impenetrable fog has parted, revealing that the [mem_crucible_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] appear to have once again regressed into the stone age."
 mem_crucible.5.a:0 "How very odd."

 mem_crucible.6.name:0 "Shrouding"
 mem_crucible.6.desc:0 "Our observation post over [From.GetName] reports that they have lost all contact with the surface beneath due to bizarre fog that has suddenly engulfed the planet. \n\nIt's as if planet were reacting adversely to our presence."
 mem_crucible.6.a:0 "Troubling."

 mem_crucible.7.name:0 "Shrouding"
 mem_crucible.7.desc:0 "We have lost all contact with [Root.GetName]. It appears that the planet's surface has been engulfed in a strange fog. \n\nIt's as if planet were reacting adversely to our presence."
 mem_crucible.7.a:0 "Troubling."

 mem_crucible.8.name:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Encountered"
 mem_crucible.8.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] reports that they have encountered a primitive civilisation on the surface of [From.GetName]. \n\nWhat is odd is that the population of this planet appears to have gone completely mad, tearing down their advanced infrastructure, rioting and engaging in senseless violence. \n\nWe should consider building an §YObservation Post§! above their world to study them more closely."

 mem_crucible.11.name:0 "Shrouding"
 mem_crucible.11.desc:0 "Our ships over [From.GetName] report that they cannot continue bombardment due to a bizarre fog that has suddenly engulfed the planet, cutting all visibility of and contact with the surface. \n\nIt's as if planet were reacting adversely to our actions."
 mem_crucible.11.a:0 "How very odd."

 mem_crucible.100.name:0 "The Mystery of Crucible"
 mem_crucible.100.desc:0 "We have observed the same pattern repeat on [From.GetName]: A civilisation rises and advances at an abnormally rapid pace, only to collapse into madness and be engulfed in a strange purple fog. The fog then parts, revealing a population that has regressed into the stone age, and the pattern begins anew. It's as if some mysterious force is guiding this process towards an uncertain goal."
 mem_crucible.100.a:0 "We need to get to the bottom of this."
 mem_crucible.100.b:0 "Who cares?"
 mem_crucible.100.b.tooltip:0 "Disable most notifications from [From.GetName]."

 mem_crucible.101.name:0 "Survey of [mem_crucible_planet.GetName]"
 mem_crucible.101.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] reports on the successful completion of a comprehensive study of [From.GetName]. \n\nThe planet does not appear to be particularly unusual. However, it appears to be affected somehow by its primary - [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName]. The surveyors have intercepted some kind of signal exchange back and forth between the planets, although it's too early to say what is being transmitted and for what purpose."
 mem_crucible.101.a:0 "We need to learn more."

 mem_crucible.102.name:0 "Survey of [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName]"
 mem_crucible.102.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] was not able to study the surface of [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] in great detail. However, they have still managed to find out more than had been known before. \n\nSome kind of activity is definitely going on down there - an immense amount of energy is being stored. It remains unclear what is going on and for what purpose, but we are closer to fully unveiling this planet's mysteries than ever before."
 mem_crucible.102.a:0 "What does the shroud hide?"

 mem_crucible.200.name:0 "The Mystery of the Crucible"
 mem_crucible.200.desc:0 "Now that we have managed to both intercept strange transmissions between [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] and [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] and roughly map out the latter's surface, we are coming closer to uncovering the true nature of the entire [mem_crucible_planet.Solar_System.GetName] system. \n\nWe can without a doubt tell that some kind of entity has orchestrated an endless loop of death and rebirth, though we can't yet tell what its purpose could possibly be. Still, whoever controls this wields immense power. Now, after partially mapping out the shrouded surface of the planet and beginning to decode the signal exchange, we can hopefully finally crack this mystery."
 mem_crucible.200.a:0 "Excellent, let us proceed."
 mem_crucible.200.b:0 "We've gone too far. Some secrets are better left unknown."

 mem_crucible.201.name:0 "The Crucible Controller"
 mem_crucible.201.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] [Leader.GetHasHave] been able to modify the sensor array of [Root.GetName] to penetrate the mysterious shroud and find out the reason behind the strange occurrences in the [mem_crucible_controller_planet.Solar_System.GetName] system. \n\nDeep within the fog of [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] lies an ancient and powerful machine called the "§YController§!". It's been tasked with a single purpose - to prevent a being called §SVoldareen§! from escaping its moon. However, within the parameters given to the system, the task is unsolvable. All the Controller can do is to create mortal shells to house pieces of Voldareen, trapped in a strange cycle of maturing, only to snuff its progress once it gets too close to escaping. On its own, the cycle will never end until the Controller completely breaks down."
 mem_crucible.201.a:0 "Shut the Controller down."
 mem_crucible.201.a.tooltip:0 "Voldareen will escape, freeing the Gaia world of [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] for us to claim."
 mem_crucible.201.b:0 "Improve the Controller's efficiency."
 mem_crucible.201.c:0 "We can find a more permanent solution to Voldareen."
 mem_crucible.201.d:0 "Repurpose the Controller for our use." #Not implemented yet
 mem_crucible.201.e:0 "Let the Controller continue its cycle uninterrupted."

 mem_crucible.301.name:0 "True Voldareen"
 mem_crucible.301.desc:0 "The Voldareen entity has been formed, escaping the confines of [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] and leaving its mortal shells behind. \n\nThis powerful psionic being now poses a threat to the entire system, if not beyond."
 mem_crucible.301.a:0 "We must prepare for the fight."

 mem_crucible.302.xenophile:0 "May I ask you something? \n\nDo you always just break down someone else's projects without any consideration? Did it occur to you that maybe your machinations could lead to unexpected consequences? \n\nWe'd like to know if it was a random lapse of judgement, or do you just like going around the galaxy trashing things that aren't yours?"
 mem_crucible.302.xenophobe:0 "Worthless [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]! \n\nDo you have any idea what you've done? Did you have any idea what were you going to do? \n\nYour idiotic meddling has put the entire galaxy in danger!"
 mem_crucible.302.a:0 "Seemed like a good idea at the time..."
 mem_crucible.302.b:0 "We just wanted to see what would happen."
 mem_crucible.302.c:0 "This madness had to end."
 mem_crucible.302.d:0 "We can do whatever we please in our territory."

 mem_crucible.310.name:0 "Voldareen Solution"
 mem_crucible.310.desc:0 "Though the crew of the [Root.GetName] was not able to truly "solve" the Voldareen problem, they have managed to break the rebirth loop. \n\nThe dense fog has fully engulfed [mem_crucible_planet.GetName], forever cutting the planet from our reality. Without the need for it, the Controller has lowered its defences, removing the dense shroud over [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] and shutting down, leaving the planet and its strange technology for us to claim."

 mem_crucible.320.name:0 "Voldareen Solution"
 mem_crucible.320.desc:0 "Using our understanding of psionics, [Leader.GetName] was able to formulate an alternative solution for the Voldareen problem. \n\nThe malignant psi-entity has been effectively neutralized, leaving the constructed Voldareen shells - the [mem_crucible_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] - to gain true freedom. \n\nFinally fulfilling its purpose, the Controller has lowered its defences, leaving both [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] and [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] to our discretion."

 #Ages
 mem_crucible_insanity_age:0 "Collective Insanity"
 mem_crucible_insanity_age_desc:0 "The population of the planet, previously relatively advanced, is taken by some sort of collective psychosis, engaging in random senseless violence and the mad chanting of nonsensical mantras."

 MEM_CRUCIBLE_CONTACT_THE_CONTROLLER_DESC:0 "Whatever is causing the endless loop on [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] is hiding on [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName]. \n\nTime to find it."
 MEM_CRUCIBLE_SOLVE_THE_PROBLEM:0 "Solving the Problem"
 MEM_CRUCIBLE_SOLVE_THE_PROBLEM_DESC:0 "The Crucible Controller has hit a wall trying to find out a solution to its problem. It could use an outside perspective."
 MEM_CRUCIBLE_CHANGE_THE_PROBLEM:0 "Changing the Parameters"
 MEM_CRUCIBLE_CHANGE_THE_PROBLEM_DESC:0 "The Crucible Controller can't solve the problem within the parameters it is given. \n\nBut with our own understanding of psionic forces, we can give it a true solution."
