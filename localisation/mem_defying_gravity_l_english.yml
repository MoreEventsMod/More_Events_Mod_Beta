 #Anomaly
 mem_defying_gravity_category:0 "Defying Gravity"
 mem_defying_gravity_category_desc:0 "We are detecting some kind of object hovering above [Root.GetName] where, by all means, it should have crashed onto the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface long ago."

 #Events
 mem_defying_gravity.100.name:0 "Phantom Readings"
 mem_defying_gravity.100.desc:0 "After a repeat investigation, [Root.GetName] reports that the strange object supposedly "hovering" above [From.GetName] is actually a result of improper sensor reading. \n\nSeemingly, static electricity in the atmosphere is thorwing off our calibration resulting in phantom objects appearing on some scans. Despite overall disappointment, this is still an interesting phenomena worth studying."
 mem_defying_gravity.100.a:0 "A bit anticlimactic."

 mem_defying_gravity.200.name:0 "Advertising Blimp"
 mem_defying_gravity.200.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that a mysterious object found hovering above [From.GetName] is, in fact, a brightly illuminated platform, suspended via anti-gravity and broadcasting what seems to be commercial information. \n\nPreliminary analysis suggests that the platform is over 2000 years old. Whoever built it is probably long dead, but the message about their generous discount on moochwazarxes remains ethernal."
 mem_defying_gravity.200.a:0 "What is a moochwazarx anyway?"

 mem_defying_gravity.300.name:0 "Suspended Asteroid"
 mem_defying_gravity.300.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that the strange object suspended over [From.GetName] is, in fact, a completely mundane asteroid. \n\nThe odd thing is located right below it - a massive complex emitting some kind of beam that keeps asteroid from falling on the surface. The complex appears to be completely autonomous and no other signs of advanced life are detected on the planet."
 mem_defying_gravity.300.a:0 "Who built it here?"
 mem_defying_gravity.300.a.tooltip:0 "£Building  $mem_building_defying_gravity_asteroid_suspension$ is added on [From.GetName]. It's probably a good idea to keep it there."

 mem_defying_gravity.301.name:0 "Unsuspended"
 mem_defying_gravity.301.desc:0 "Due to deactivation of $mem_building_defying_gravity_asteroid_suspension$ on [Root.GetName], asteroid above it continued its voyage unimpended and crashed into the planet, leaving massive crater."
 mem_defying_gravity.301.a:0 "Oh well..."
 mem_defying_gravity.301.a.tooltip:0 "Surface of [Root.GetName] gets a new £blocker  Crater."

 mem_defying_gravity.400.name:0 "Sea's Shadow"
 mem_defying_gravity.400.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports something truly bizzare. \n\nIt appears the suspended object above [From.GetName] is not an object at all. \n\nIt is, in fact, an optical illusion caused by a flat "sea" of exotic particles covering parts of the planet. Somehow it creates an illusory sphere hovering above the largest cocnentration. \n\nThe exotic particles should not impede life on the surface, but would likely provide a lot of data on forms of exotic matter."
 mem_defying_gravity.400.a:0 "This definitely warrants a study."

 #Modifiers
 mem_defying_gravity_blimp_modifier:0 "Advertising Blimp"
 mem_defying_gravity_blimp_modifier_desc:0 "A small station is hovering over this planet, broadcasting important information regarding discount moochwazarxes."
 mem_defying_gravity_strange_thing:0 "Sea's Shadow"
 mem_defying_gravity_strange_thing_desc:0 "The planet is littered with regions covered with exotic matter, reflecting in the sky above as a giant ball."

 #Ambient Objects
 mem_defying_gravity_blimp:0 "Advertising Blimp"
 mem_defying_gravity_asteroid:0 "Suspended Ateroid"

 #Building
 mem_building_defying_gravity_asteroid_suspension:0 "Suspension Field Generator"
 mem_building_defying_gravity_asteroid_suspension_desc:0 "A mysterious construction generating a directed suspension field, preventing a large asteroid from falling on the surface. \n\n§RRemoving it would likely cause asteroid to continue its fall.§!"
