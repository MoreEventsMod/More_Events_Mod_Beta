 d_mem_crystals_mining:0 "Crystal Fields"
 d_mem_crystals_mining_desc:0 "An area covered with semi-living mineral formations spawned by an ancient void crystal. Periodically harvesting these crystals will significantly increase the mineral output capacity of this colony but at the price of a weakened ecosystem and reduced agricultural output."
 
 d_mem_crystals_science:0 "Crystal Fields"
 d_mem_crystals_science_desc:0 "An evergrowing area covered with semi-living mineral formations spawned by an ancient void crystal. Studying these crystals will benefit the colony's research efforts, while reducing its mineral and agricultural output capacities."

 mem_crystal_removal_desc:0 "A significant part of this colony's efforts go into the removal of the crystal infestation, which has now spread over the planet."

 # Crystal appears in player system
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.name:0 "Crystalline Entity Approaches"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.1.desc:0 "Our colony's long-range sensors have picked up an alarming signal approaching from out of deep space. A hastily-dispatched probe revealed it to be a giant crystalline structure. A communication attempt from our vessel was followed by an intense energy spike and immediate loss of contact with the probe.\n\nWe have to assume the crystal is hostile. Our fleet has been put on high alert."

 # crystal has bombarded the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.name:0 "Death from Above"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.desc:0 "The colonial defence force stood no chance against the crystal entity. Immediately after the battle had been decided, it started to shower [This.GetName] with small crystal shards fired at high velocity. First reports speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties.\n\nWhile these numbers still rise by the hour, the crystal has left the planet's orbit and flown back into the void."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.desc.gestalt:0 "The colonial defence force was defeated by the crystal entity. Immediately after the battle had been decided, it started to shower [This.GetName] with small crystal shards fired at high velocity. Damage to the colony's infrastructure has been substantial and many drones have been lost.\n\nTthe crystal has left the planet's orbit and flown back into deep space."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.a:0 "How terrible!"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.2.b:0 "Unfortunate." 

 # crystal has been destroyed before bombarding the colony
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.name:0 "Danger Averted"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.3.desc:0 "Our fleet has been victorious. Only broken shards are left of the crystal entity. Why it came here and attacked might never be revealed, but our colony is safe once again.\n\nA brief scan of the crystal's remains showed them to be composed of highly valuable minerals. Nearby freighters have already been ordered to gather them. While most of these shards will be scraped for resources, the more interesting pieces will be kept for further study.\n\nSome of our scientists already fantasize about possible applications like self-repairing hulls, while others point out that there is much foundational research to be done before we can even hope for a big breakthrough."

 # Project finished
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.name:0 "Crystal Analysis"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.desc:0 "The recovered crystal shards show remarkable similarities to the smaller specimens we have encountered before, yet there is a striking difference in their behaviour. While previously-encountered crystals acted aggressively, their actions had always been limited to their own territory. Also, the enormous size of this larger specimen leads our scientists to the conclusion that it has to be a new species.\n\nThe material which makes up almost the entirety of its mass possesses astonishing self-repairing abilities, a property that may be applied to our ship's armor plates given more time and research. A new research option has been added to the project pool."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.5.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 # crystals grow everywhere, what now?
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.name:0 "Crystal Infestation"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.desc:0 "As the colonists on [Root.GetName] were still recovering from the devastating attack, we received worrying reports about crystalline fragments growing in various locations around the settlements.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the spreading of these crystals is not limited to the vicinity of the colony. Instead, they can be found in varying concentrations across the planet, slowly extracting minerals from the soil throughout their growing process. It is hard to tell at this point how this will affect the planet's ecosystem.\n\nThere are multiple possible courses of action to be taken. The colonists can try to root out the crystal infestation, periodically harvest them, or study their growth."

 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.c:0 "Let them root out the crystal infestation."
 mem_space_monster_attacks.6.c.tooltip:0 "Our colony on [Root.GetName] will focus on removing every last crystal spawn. All minerals gained during this process will be added to the empire storage at the end of this process. The productivity of this colony will be reduced by 50% until this process is completed. It is to be expected that the planet's ecosystem will be able to fully recover once the work is done."
 
 # planet turns bleak
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.name:0 "Biosphere Changes"
 mem_space_monster_attacks.7.desc:0 "Despite the colonists' constant efforts to contain the crystal infestation, the spreading has now reached a critical extent. The damage to the planet's ecosystem is now undeniable. Farming outputs are at record lows and vegetation in general is in a state of steady decline as the crystals exhaust the soil.\n\nThough our scientists are confident that they can prevent the planet from becoming completely lifeless, they doubt that this process can be reversed without extensive terraforming."

 decision_mem_crystal_fields_seeding:0 "Crystal Field Seeding"
 decision_mem_crystal_fields_seeding_desc:0 "A crystal field will be seeded, providing increased mineral extraction as well as a source of rare crystals. However, continued crystalline growth will degrade this planet's ecosystem."

 tech_mem_crystal_cultivation:0 "Crystal Cultivation"
 tech_mem_crystal_cultivation_desc:0 "Advances in ecological adaption will allow us to seed new crystal fields within controlled environments. This process degrades the host planet's ecosystem, but damages will remain within acceptable parameters."
