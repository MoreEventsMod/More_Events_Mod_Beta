 mem_caretaker.1.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! has completed its survey of an abandoned habitat station in the §Y[From.Solar_System.GetName] System§!. Despite its advanced age, it still seems to be operational, even if at half capacity. \n\nLife signs detected inside indicate the presence of numerous small creatures. Though they do not possess true sapience, they appear to be bred or genetically engineered to have an instinctive understanding of complex machinery. Besides a few collapsed sections, they have kept station habitable for a long period of time, presumably waiting for the rightful owners to arrive and claim the habitat. \n\nWe might be able to uplift these lesser beings, with the right technology."
