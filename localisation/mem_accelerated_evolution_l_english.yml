 mem_accelerated_evolution.1.desc:0 "After several months of living on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, the colonists noticed something odd about the surrounding environment. Species seem to drastically change from one month to the next. On the order of the colony's administration, a quick study was performed, which revealed native flora and fauna possess incredibly fast evolutionary processes. It appears that sexual and asexual reproduction, along with a shorter than average life cycle, seem to be traits that all species on this world share.\n\nOn one hand, repeatedly adapting to the local biosphere prevents the colonists from ever truly fitting in - nothing with an ordinary evolutionary cycle could. On the other, studying the constant evolution and rapid breeding of the local animals could lead to advancements in farming and evolutionary science. Either way, the biosphere of a planet is too complicated to change on this sort of scale. The colonists are saddled with this, for good or ill."
