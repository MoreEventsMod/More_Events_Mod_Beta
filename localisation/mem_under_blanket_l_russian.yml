 # First Event
 mem_under_blanket.1.name:0 "Under the Blanket"
 mem_under_blanket.1.desc:0 "Early reports have speak of mysterious activity in the deep underground of [Root.GetName]. Analysis of the scanned signatures point to the existence of a formerly unknown species. Our scientists are more than eager to attempt a ground operation to study them."
 mem_under_blanket.1.materialist:0 "We should study them right away. This is an exciting discovery."
 mem_under_blanket.1.xenomilit:0 "These xenos could be dangerous. Take all the necessary precautions."
 mem_under_blanket.1.others:0 "Send them in but take all the necessary safety precautions."
 mem_under_blanket.1.deny:0 "They have more important work to do."
 
 # Event Selection
 mem_under_blanket.2.name:0 "Leadership Crisis"
 mem_under_blanket.2.desc:0 "After a brief scientific collective, all resources and funds have been assigned, and the expedition is almost ready to begin. However, the forum could not yet decide who should lead the expedition. They ask for your opinion.\n\nThe candidates for expedition leadership are:"
 mem_under_blanket.2.firstleader:0 "[mem_under_blanket_firstleader.GetName], recognized as an expert in the field."
 mem_under_blanket.2.firstleader.random:0 "[mem_under_blanket_firstleader_random.GetName], whose profile is more than noteworthy."
 mem_under_blanket.2.secondleader:0 "[mem_under_blanket_secondleader.GetName], who is known for being decisive."
 mem_under_blanket.2.secondleader.random:0 "[mem_under_blanket_secondleader_random.GetName], who is showing great aptitude."
 mem_under_blanket.2.thirdleader:0 "[mem_under_blanket_thirdleader.GetName], an able scientist and volunteer."
 
 # Ground Team
 mem_under_blanket.3.name:0 "Ground Team"
 mem_under_blanket.3.desc:0 "Our expedition has passed the first layers of sedimentary rock and is reporting back. Multiple signs of artificial erosion around the walls indicates the presense lifeforms. An estimation approximates that thousands of this species' individuals are nearby or have passed through this very location. The team's proximity sensors alarmed the team of approaching signatures. Forced to stop, they heard the rustling of rock nearing closer to them. Should these aliens be aggressive our small expedition could potentially be overrun within moments.\n\nContact is imminent."
 mem_under_blanket.3.retreat.xenomilit:0 "To all units, retreat immediately."
 mem_under_blanket.3.retreat.others:0 "It's too dangerous to proceed. Retreat."
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.materialist:0 "What are their intentions? Did we disturb them?"
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.xenomilit:0 "Get the soldiers ready. Protect the scientists."
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.others:0 "Proceed the investigation with much caution."
 
 # Retreat - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.4.name:0 "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.4.desc:0 "After receiving the order, the squad quickly tried to escape. Loud, guttural groans of the unknown xeno vibrated around the cave's walls. Out of the shadows, dozens of beasts charged our team, and three of our soldiers were instantly ripped to shreds. Breaching from the walls, multiple large claws violently eviscerated six other members. Only [mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] and one soldier managed to make it to the exit. Feeling it was his sense of duty to protect [Root.GetName], the remaining soldier sacrificed himself with an emergency nuclear warhead, allowing the ship fly away uninterrupted and leave the horror behind."
 mem_under_blanket.4.xenomilit:0 "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.4.others:0 "We will remember them."
 
 # Retreat - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.5.name:0 "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.5.desc:0 "While exiting, the group barely realized than an almost undetectable moving form was following in the shadows. Our soldiers took the initiative to shoot the invisible object with powerful energy emitter bolts, incapacitating the unknown menace. After taking back the xeno into a shielded cell on the ship, the most capable scientists concluded the speciman was a juvenile with multiple DNA mutations.\n\nThe exit to the tunnels has since been sealed."
 mem_under_blanket.5.xenomilit:0 "The dissection of this xeno will educate us."
 mem_under_blanket.5.others:0 "Observation of this xeno will reveal his species' secrets."
 
 # Retreat - Third Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.6.name:0 "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.6.desc:0 "With caution, the expedition crew moved their way towards the exit of the tunnel.\nThe monitors were eerily silent. The team managed to secure the cave's entrance, leaving the alien life form a mystery. Our scientists had time to launch an orb scan, giving us precious architectural information.\n\n[mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] plans to keep monitoring the situation remotely."
 mem_under_blanket.6.xenomilit:0 "Bomb the site."
 mem_under_blanket.6.others:0 "This new species didn't reveal all its secrets."
 
 # First Contact - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.7.name:0 "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.7.desc:0 "[mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] orders the escort to hold back. With hesitation a small unknown figure approaches our group. The scientist extends his hand to initiate friendly contact. The wildlife carefully smells the hand before rubbing his head into it. After a brief moment, a guttural moaning noise comes out of the creature. Suddenly, [mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] gets rapidly swarmed by hundreds of these small furry specimens. These strange, innocent animals seem very sensitive to cuddling."
 mem_under_blanket.7.xenomilit:0 "They can be used as slave labour."
 mem_under_blanket.7.others:0 "Our people will likely adopt them."
 
 # First Contact - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.8.name:0 "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.8.desc:0 "The scientific mission pursues its investigations in the large chamber. Our temperature and humidity measure reveal a tropical ecosystem containing vegetation and water, perfectly designed for wildlife. Tens of thousands of small, organic creatures seem to peacefully live here. Completely ignoring the escort, the early observations tend to label the awake creatures as watchmen guarding the hibernating ones.\n\n[mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] and the scientific consortium will further the research remotely to prevent all contamination and avoid disturbing the creatures."
 mem_under_blanket.8.xenophobe:0 "Bomb the site, we can't take risks."
 mem_under_blanket.8.others:0 "A fascinating self-sufficient species."
 
 # First Contact - Third Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.9.name:0 "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.9.desc:0 "The wildlife we have discovered is far more violent and dangerous than we first expected. While trying to communicate that we came in peace, [mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] was lacerated by the claws of the beasts. We had to abort the mission and secure the zone. Thanks to our heavy autocannon sentries armed with nuclear-grade ammunition, we easily contained the rush of beasts. While the backup team secured the exit, thousands of bullets and growls could be heard behind the reinforcements being urgently built."
 mem_under_blanket.9.xenomilit:0 "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.9.others:0 "A regrettable loss."
 
 # First Contact - Fourth Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.10.name:0 "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.10.desc:0 "Even after approaching the wildlife with precautions, [mem_under_blanket_selectedleader.GetName] still ended up surrounded. The single brutal guttural groan of the alpha shred the scientist into tatters. The escort rapidly fired back but were trampled by thousands of the creatures. The last signal from the backup team reports a big earthquake before the signal suddenly shattered. We have been overrun by this dangerous wildlife.\n\nWe must abandon and secure the region immediately."
 mem_under_blanket.10.tooltip:0 "A pop is killed and §RDangerous Wildlife§! now roams over [Root.GetName]."
 mem_under_blanket.10.desc.delayed:0 "What was seen by automatic systems as regular earthquakes, in an area of [Root.GetName], alerted military radars.\n\nMultiple unknown signatures tend to converge in the cities in the East side. Shortly after a couple of cycles of invasions by these unknown signatures, we lost contact with the region. A third of the area was reported destroyed and completely overrun with no survivors. Critical orbital strikes were ordered to contain the propagation to just the near territories.\n\nAnalysis of raw data shows the invasion originated from an unexplored and unsecured underground cavity. Science department despises."
 mem_under_blanket.10.xenomilit:0 "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.10.others:0 "This is a tragedy."
