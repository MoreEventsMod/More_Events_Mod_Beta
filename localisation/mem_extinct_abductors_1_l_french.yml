 mem_extinct_abductors.3.desc:0 "In the depths of the complex on §Y[From.GetName]§!, our survey team became contaminated with a strange substance that they later discovered to be a dangerous mutagen the former holders of this place had experimented with. Back aboard the ship, several members of the survey team began to transform into twisted abominations, driven to insanity by pain and rage. These mutations spread like wildfire among the members of the crew and as the situation was getting out of control, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, the chief scientist on board, during [Root.GetHisHer] last moments of remaining sanity, was able to set a collision course with the planet. The following FTL impact destroyed large parts of §Y[From.GetName]§!, including the complex the team had investigated earlier - thus averting any further threat."

There are crystal formations, rarely more than one or two metres in width and height, littering the entire planet's surface, each just a few dozen metres from the next.\n\nShortly after they took samples of one of those formations, the §Y[Root.GetName]§! detected an incoming hostile signal at the edge of the solar system.

 mem_ea_uplifter.10.desc:0 "It remains unclear why the crystalline entity chose this planet to be its host. The results of this decision are however quite obvious. Our science team found only small traces of what was once the dominant species on this planet. Their end was inevitable from the moment the crystal first appeared. Their technology must have been far too primitive for them to possess any means of defence against it. The small crystal formations seem to have exhausted the planet's crust of most useful minerals, thus turning the planet, once lush and very much alive, into a lifeless wasteland.\n\nNow that the giant crystal has been destroyed, our scientists suggest two possible options: We could either harvest these mineral rich crystal formations or study their undisturbed growing process."

Among the various records we've recovered is also the location of the home system of the "Orila", as they called themselves. Their empire seems to have been at war with a nebulous aggressor.

 mem_ea_uplifter.15.desc_02:0 "Greed had poisoned their souls, had barricaded their world with hate, had goose-stepped them into misery and bloodshed. They had developed speed, but had shut themselves in. Machinery that gave them abundance had left them in want. Their knowledge had made them cynical; their cleverness, hard and unkind. They thought too much and felt too little. More than machinery, they needed fellowship. More than cleverness, they needed kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, their way of life was violent, and they threatened the lives of others."

 mem_ea_uplifter.15.c.response:0 "I am an image of the consciousness of the Orila Chap'Lin. I am more than a mere AI but less than a living being. To be what I am is an honour as well as a burden... A burden I readily chose to accept. Since the last of our race passed away, it has been my responsibility to maintain what is left of this world and ensure the continuous function of its planetary barrier shield. But my most important task has been to wait for your arrival."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d:0 "What happened to your race?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.d.response:0 "There was a time in which our technological progress outmatched our ability to foresee possible consequences. We recklessly pursued our quest for immortality. Once we became aware of the consequences the damage was already done. Continuous cloning had left our race sterile and slowly succumbing to the inevitable degradation of our gene pool."
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.e:0 "Why did you uplift other species?"
 mem_ea_uplifter.15.e.response:0 "When we faced our inevitable demise, we saw that there was no other civilisation ready or willing to protect less advanced species against ruthless aggression.

We believed that in this universe there was room for everyone, and that our galaxy was rich and could provide for everyone; that the way of life could be free and beautiful. But others lost the way..."
 mem_ea_uplifter.16.desc_02:0 "This is true. Your race was among the five most promising of our protégés. Unfortunately, before we could finish what we had begun, we were attacked by those who sought to profit from our growing weakness. Though our technology was vastly superior to theirs, they found strength in numbers while ours dwindled. In the end, we were forced to retreat to our homeworld, which became our prison. From here we had to watch our children fade away. And now all of my people's hopes lie in you and your race."
