 mem_agrarian_dig_site: "Agrarian Idyll"
 mem_agrarian_dig_site_desc: "A small isolated region on this planet is covered in neat rows of farm plots - overgrown with plants, but still recognizable. This feature looks very out of place, especially considering that these are the only pre-existing artificial structures on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nMechanized farming equipment is can be found gathering rust in the fields, while the farm owners are nowhere to be found."

 mem_agrarian.1.name: "Mass Grave"
 mem_agrarian.1.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! has uncovered the remains of the previous inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nOn the outskirts of the settlement, [Leader.GetSheHe] discovered a trench where multiple bodies in bags were dumped before concrete was poured over them. The trench appears to be segmented with filling of uneven quality, suggesting that the process of dumping the bodies took months if not years. The bodies discovered inside are estimated to account for about 60-80% of the households, depending on how communal the species was. \n\nNo obvious signs of trauma are found on the bodies, nor any traces of radioactive contamination, known poisons or corrosives. However, due to the lack of living specimens for reference and the sorry state of the mass grave in general, it is impossible to infer a cause of death."
 mem_agrarian.2.name: "The Hospital"
 mem_agrarian.2.desc: "We have discovered a half-buried building on the outskirts of the settlement. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! believes that it served as a hospital while the colony was still alive. \n\nThe building itself was mostly cleared out and a lot of documents destroyed. Although it appears that the settlers preferred to opt for low-tech solutions such as plant-based writing surfaces, clay brickwork and wooden furniture, when necessary they had access to advanced technology such as sophisticated medical scanners and molecular pharmaceutical printers. \n\nThe hospital records have faded away, though §Y[Leader.GetName]§! Infers that a highly contagious disease affected the settlers at some point."
 mem_agrarian.3.name: "The Antenna"
 mem_agrarian.3.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports uncovering something odd right in the middle of the abandoned settlement on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nAt a relatively shallow depth, the archaeologists have found an extremely tall antenna. Its foundation seems to be deliberately placed right in the middle of the settlement, likely to ensure stable coverage. The antenna is not designed for any faster-than-light specifications, but nevertheless it is arguably the most advanced piece of technology recovered yet. \n\nThe exact nature of the signal transmitted is uncertain at the moment, but it is likely that the source of the signal could be found underground, right under the antenna."
 mem_agrarian.4.name: "Biomass Control"
 mem_agrarian.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports successfully breaching the underground complex beneath the antenna on [From.Planet.GetName]. Compared to the rest of the settlement, it is extremely advanced, placing it on the technological level of an average space faring civilisation. Most of the equipment is broken, but some data was still recovered. The events leading to the extinction of the planet's population can now be pieced together. \n\nThe settlers originated from a civilisation that was active in a distant part of the galaxy and were a group of primitivist seeking to escape what they perceived as oppressive technological society stifling their spirituality. \n\nWith only the limited technology they deemed necessary, they made their way to [From.Planet.GetName] and established a colony. In order to bolster their ranks and provide them with a workforce sufficient for the colony's operation, they brought specially designed programmable biomass - which was at the time inferior to robotic technology but better suited for their primitivist way of life. \n\nThe underground complex and antenna were, in fact, a control system for the biomass constructs."
 mem_agrarian.5.name: "The Masterpiece"
 mem_agrarian.5.desc: "After extensive research, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! has pieced together the rest of the events that caused to the colony on [From.Planet.GetName] to collapse. \n\nFor a while, the colony operated smoothly and settlers enjoyed a simple life, until they encountered an infection, likely native to the world. Most of them succumbed quickly, but for a small fraction it would take years to die. Despite the quarantine measures, the spread of the infection could not be stopped, and all the settlers contracted it. The only unaffected form of life was the biomass. Realizing they were doomed, settlers opted to copy their minds into the biomass control system and live their lives as constructs. \n\nOne technician involved however had a different plan. Seeing himself as some kind of ultimate artist, he sabotaged the transfer system to give himself full access to the personality cores. After the process was complete, he wiped the other settlers of all memory of their true nature and dedicated all his time to tinkering with their personalities. Unaware of anything that was happening or who they really were, the practically immortal settlers relived the same day again and again as biomass constructs among slowly decaying buildings and neglected fields, while the only self-aware person kept altering their personalities and memories to create something more to his liking. \n\nThis process lasted for about 40 years until a power outage interrupted the transmission and caused all the constructs to disintegrate. It seems the only person who knew that the complex even existed had no interest in maintaining it."
 mem_agrarian.5.a: "A fascinating tale."

 d_mem_agrarian_deposit_desc: "A sizeable area once settled by a group of alien colonists. The fertile lands lie abandoned after their owners died out from an epidemic."
