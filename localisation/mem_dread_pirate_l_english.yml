 mem_dread_pirate.2.desc: "After destroying one of the raiding ships sent by the §S[marauder_sender.GetName]§! in the §Y[combat_system.GetName] System§! or forces have recovered an intact datacore with some interesting information. \n\nThe core tells of a §SDread Pirate Raewynn§! who was somewhat of a [marauder_sender.GetAdj] legend. He has roamed the galaxy centuries before [Root.GetName] ventured into space and apparently disappeared somewhere in the §Y[the_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System§!. Otherwise unremarkable [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] [the_planet.GetName] is now believed to be his resting place. \n\nEven though we have surveyed this [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] before and didn't find anything related to it, this new data might warrant a closer look."
 mem_dread_pirate.2.a: "We should investigate."

 mem_dread_pirate.3.name: "Dread Pirate's Base"
 mem_dread_pirate.3.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports successfully finding the lair of the Dread Pirate Raewynn. A shielded bunker built into a cliffside of a tall mountain eluded our scans until now, but with the use of the marauder data, we now know better. \n\nIt seems that we weren't here the first. Several expeditions seem to have made their way into the bunker and much of their equipment and the bodies remain. It will take considerable effort to sift through both our predecessors' work and the sprawling underground complex hidden on [the_planet.GetName]"
 mem_dread_pirate.3.a: "Establish the dig site."

 mem_dread_pirate_dig_site_desc: "A hidden complex on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is thought to be a resting place of the legendary Dread Pirate Raewynn. \n\nMaybe ventured here before, and most seem to have left empty-handed or died inside."
 mem_dread_pirate.11.name: "The Antechamber"
 mem_dread_pirate.11.desc: "We have made our way deeper inside the uderground complex on [From.Planet.GetName] and reached a large room that used to serve as a hangar or storage room of a sort. \n\nInside the room, multiple tents and archaeological equipment had been set up by the previous explorers, but no occupants or their remains were found so far. [Leader.GetName] has located a datapad containing the following message: \n\n\"§SI am getting out of here. This is a warning for all that would come after Dread Pirate's Mask. You will find nothing here, only death and failure. More than a hundred of us have entered here and only a few left. The rest have fallen victims to traps and their own greed.§!\""
