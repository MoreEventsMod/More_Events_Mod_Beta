 mem_dread_pirate.2.name: "Legend of the Dread Pirate"
 mem_dread_pirate.2.desc: "After destroying one of the raiding ships sent by the §S[marauder_sender.GetName]§! in the §Y[combat_system.GetName] System§! or forces have recovered an intact datacore with some interesting information. \n\nThe core tells of a §SDread Pirate Raewynn§! who was somewhat of a [marauder_sender.GetAdj] legend. He has roamed the galaxy centuries before [Root.GetName] ventured into space and apparently disappeared somewhere in the §Y[the_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System§!. Otherwise unremarkable [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] [the_planet.GetName] is now believed to be his resting place. \n\nEven though we have surveyed this [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] before and didn't find anything related to it, this new data might warrant a closer look."
 mem_dread_pirate.2.a: "We should investigate."

 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_PROJECT: "Investigate the Dread Pirate lead"
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_PROJECT_DESC: "Otherwise unremarkable [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! is rumoured to be the last resting place of the §SDread Pirate Raewynn§!. It might be worth a closer look."

 mem_dread_pirate.3.name: "Dread Pirate's Base"
 mem_dread_pirate.3.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports successfully finding the lair of the Dread Pirate Raewynn. A shielded bunker built into a cliffside of a tall mountain eluded our scans until now, but with the use of the marauder data, we now know better. \n\nIt seems that we weren't here the first. Several expeditions seem to have made their way into the bunker and much of their equipment and the bodies remain. It will take considerable effort to sift through both our predecessors' work and the sprawling underground complex hidden on [the_planet.GetName]"
 mem_dread_pirate.3.a: "Establish the dig site."

 mem_dread_pirate_dig_site: "Dread Pirate's Grave"
 mem_dread_pirate_dig_site_desc: "A hidden complex on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is thought to be a resting place of the legendary Dread Pirate Raewynn. \n\nMany have ventured here before, and most seem to have left empty-handed or died inside."
 mem_dread_pirate.11.name: "The Antechamber"
 mem_dread_pirate.11.desc: "We have made our way deeper inside the uderground complex on [From.Planet.GetName] and reached a large room that used to serve as a hangar or storage room of a sort. \n\nInside the room, multiple tents and archaeological equipment had been set up by the previous explorers, but no occupants or their remains were found so far. [Leader.GetName] has located a datapad containing the following message: \n\n§S\"I am getting out of here. This is a warning for all that would come after Dread Pirate's treasure. You will find nothing here, only death and failure. More than a hundred of us have entered here and only a few left. The rest have fallen victims to traps and their own greed. Nyrran, if you somehow survive and find this message, I hope suffering and misfortune will plague the rest of your miserable days.\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.12.name: "Signs of Fighting"
 mem_dread_pirate.12.desc: "Our archaeologists have successfully mapped out upper layers of the underground complex on [From.Planet.GetName]. Multiple remains of several different species have been recovered alongside with their personal logs and belongings. \n\nIt seems several groups of explorers have travelled to this location in the past looking for ill-gained treasure that Dread Pirate Raewynn amassed including a legendary §Sceremonial mask§! he wore. This mask was a cultural icon among many marauder clans in the galaxy and whoever could recover it would command a lot of respect. \n\nTensions rose on the site as fantasies of wealth and fame clouded the archaeologists' minds until the infighting broke out over control of the digging areas. Many were killed."
 mem_dread_pirate.13.name: "Cave In"
 mem_dread_pirate.13.desc: "[Leader.GetName] just came across a massive caved-in area in a remote section of the underground complex on [From.Planet.GetName]. It appears the section was shaken by a massive explosion with over a dozen of mangled dead bodies identifiable in a rubble. In a less affected section we have found a body with intact datapad on it. The last entry is following: \n\n§S\"Engineer Warres' log. Date: who cares. Nyrran fired me today. I told him that if we keep using high-power cutters in this area, we are going to hit a methan pocket nearby. She said I can leave if I don't believe in a mission. Just got back to the site to pack my stuff. Tried to talk some sense into Correl's team, but they all sided with Nyrran. They can blow themselves up without <<Speech recognition failure, noise too loud>> <<Unexpected end of recording>>\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.14.name: "The Dormitories"
 mem_dread_pirate.14.desc: "The archaeologists on [From.Planet.GetName] have found a series of rooms which they believe to be dormitories for Raewynn's crew. The crew is still here, dead and mummified in their beds. \n\nDue to the state of the bodies, it's impossible to be certain what killed them, but what is most weird about them is that the sepecies they all belonged to is not know to us. Perhaps they were part of now extinct marauder culture?"
 mem_dread_pirate.15.name: "The Excavation"
 mem_dread_pirate.15.desc: "Archaeological expedition found a massive network of tunnels below the main structure of the underground base on [From.Planet.GetName]. It seems Raewynn's forces spent considerable time looking for something in the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust. The equipment of different design, presumably placed by one of the archaeologist expeditions seeking for the Dread Pirate is sparcelly placed along the tunnels. In an abandoned makeshift camp [Leader.GetName] has found another datapad. It contains only one message: \n\n§S\"Nyrran, I will not endanger myself and the crew by waiting for you here any longer. If you come back at any point, return to the base camp. I will leave behind enough supplies and one of the shuttles for you to get of this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], but you will not find me or anyone else. The course is pre-programmed to take you to the nearest civilized system where you will hopefully be arrested for your actions. Do not attempt to change it. It was a mistake to trust you. Good luck. Perhaps it's best if we never meet again.\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.16.name: "Nyrran's fate"
 mem_dread_pirate.16.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has followed the tunnels to a massive empty chamber separate from the rest of the complex. its design and technology seems very different from what Raewynn's forces were using at the time. A hatch can be found leading to a long shaft outside, but it seems to have been collapsed by tectonic activity at some point in the past. However, no sign or Raewynn or his treasures can be seen. The only interesting part of the room is the body on the floor wearing suit with insignia identifying it as §YProfessor Nyrran§!, head of the expedition to find Dread pirate. She is still clutching a datapad. The last entry reads: \n\n§S\"Coming here was a mistake. Even if Raewynn was ever here, he's gone. The sacrifices I have made were for nothing. There's not enough oxygen left to make it to the surface, even if I wanted to, but the only thing waiting for me outside is arrest and trial for the sacrifices I had to make to get here. All the idiots who killed each other or themselves to get ahead of me will be pinned on me. The rest of my crew is either dead or abandoned me. I will stay here waiting for death\"§!"
 mem_dread_pirate.16.a: "So the legend of Dread Pirate was a lie?"

 mem_dread_pirate.23.name: "Pirate Flotilla"
 mem_dread_pirate.23.desc: "A contingent of pirate ships has entered out system §Y[FromFrom.GetName]§!. \n\nThey do not appear "
 mem_dread_pirate.24.desc: "Greetings. It is I, §SDread Pirate Raewynn§!. \n\nIt has come to my attention that you ransaked my §Y\"Tomb\"§Y on [the_planet.GetName]. As you can see, the rumours of my death are somewhat innacurate, however I did have to leave some of my belongings down there. \n\nI would like to have my mask back, please. "
 mem_dread_pirate.24.a: "We didn't find your mask down there."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.a.response: "Is it so? I don't believe you. \n\nYou have ransaked my base quite thorougly. Perhaps a little demonstration of firepower would teach you not to lie to people like this."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.b: "Your mask is our now. (Lie)"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.b.response: "So, this is the way you choose to go? Perhaps a little demonstration of my power would make you change your mind."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.c: "What's in this mask to you?"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.c.response: "It holds great sentimental value, of course. But it's also a symbol of my power. \n\nWithout it, it's harder to rally forces to my cause."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.d: "You don't look like a dread pirate."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.d.response: "Why? I am [convo_portrait.Species.GetName]. Have you never encountered our war fleets to not dread us?"
 mem_dread_pirate.24.e: "How are you alive after all those years."
 mem_dread_pirate.24.e.response: "You'll be surprised what clean leaving and good eating habits can do to you."
 mem_dread_pirate.26.name: "Dread Pirate Flagship Destroyed"
 mem_dread_pirate.26.desc.1: "We have successfully taken down the flagship of the §SDread Pirate§! in §Y[combat_system.GetName]§!. He has come to our territory seeking his mask, which means neither of us has it. \n\nThe should search the debris of the ship looking for more information - perhaps there could be other clues we missed."
 mem_dread_pirate.26.desc.2: "Dread Pirate's flagship went down fighting the forces of [ship_killer.GetName]. He has come to our territory seeking his mask, which means neither of us has it. \n\nThe should search the debris of the ship looking for more information - perhaps there could be other clues we missed."
 mem_dread_pirate.26.a: "Proceed."

 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_BOARDING_PROJECT: "Board the Flagship"
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_BOARDING_PROJECT_DESC: "Dread Pirate have come to our system looking for his mask, even though we don't have it. Now that his ship is a lifeless wreck, we can send in a science team to find out more about it."
 mem_dread_pirate.27.name: "Not So Dread Pirate"
 mem_dread_pirate.27.desc: "We have suspected that the so-called \"Dread Pirate\" we encountered in [combat_system.GetName] was an imposter, and after studying what remains of his flagship we can confirm this. \n\nThe owner of that ship was merely a marauder warlord following a subscape signal originating from the Raewynn's base on [the_planet.GetName] on a remote device that presumably once belonged to the real one. This is likely how he knew we have visited the complex. \n\nWith this information, we were able to isolate previously hidden similar subspace signal being transmitted from the complex. Perhaps it could point us to the Dread Pirate's real resting place?"
 mem_dread_pirate.27.a: "We should investigate."
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_TRIANGULATION_PROJECT: "Trace the Signal"
 MEM_DREAD_PIRATE_TRIANGULATION_PROJECT_DESC: "The complex on §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! appears to still maintain subspace communications with other Dread Pirate's properties. Knowing this, we might be able to uncover more of his history and perhaps even retrieve the legendary mask he wore."
