 mem_abandoned_mecha_category_desc:0 "Radiometric dating indicates that the world of [From.GetName] has been in a nuclear winter for around 800 years. It is covered in the ruins of a civilization that once graced its surface. However, many of those ruins, some of which are even visible from orbit, are inconsistent with any previously discovered archaeological sites."

 mem_abandoned_mecha.10.desc:0 "It would appear as though the defunct civilizations on [From.GetName] had been in a state of global conflict long before the invention of nuclear weapons. According to Scientist [Root.GetLeaderName]'s findings, before nuclear technology could even be theorized, the civilizations on [From.GetName] invested considerable effort into making bigger and deadlier conventional weapons of war. In particular, they developed armoured bipedal, tripedal and quadrupedal machines, similar to the [root.owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]' tanks. [Root.GetLeaderName] has dubbed these weapons "mecha".\n\nWe have translated records indicating that after several decades of waging war with these machines, nuclear fission was discovered. The balance of power shifted, and atomic weapons were promptly designed. With no time to build up a large stockpile on each side (and thereby form the concept of mutually assured destruction), bombs were dropped as soon as they became available, which caused these civilizations to discover firsthand the long-term effects of such weapons.\n\nNow the abandoned mecha litter the surface. While most of the technology found in the ruins is outdated from our perspective, the mecha provide an all new outlook of mechanics. Since so many can be found half-built, fully intact, and half-destroyed, we have plenty of opportunities to research them."

 mem_abandoned_mecha.20.a:0 "Very well."
