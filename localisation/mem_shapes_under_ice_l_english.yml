 mem_shapes_under_ice_category:0 "Mysterious Shapes"
 mem_shapes_under_ice_category_desc:0 "Even from high orbit, strange dark spots on the surface of §Y[Root.GetName]§! can be seen in the hundreds of thousands. However, after only a few days in orbit, our survey crew have already noticed the shapes shifting about; some have faded, some have appeared, and many have slightly changed position."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.1.name:0 "Massive Nautiloids"
 mem_shapes_under_ice.1.desc:0 "Upon closer inspection and the launching of probes underneath the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has determined that the entire planet is covered in ocean, which is in turn covered by a thick layer of ice. However, light can penetrate the immense covering, supporting a lush ecosystem of aquatic creatures. Most notable, however, are the culprits behind §Y[From.GetName]§!'s shifting spots: gigantic nautiloids, kilometers wide, which occupy the top spot in the world's ecosystem, with no natural predators. A special project has been issued to study these creatures in better detail."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.1.a:0 "Look at the size of those things!"
 MEM_SHAPES_UNDER_ICE_PROJECT:0 "Investigate Nautiloids"
 MEM_SHAPES_UNDER_ICE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A survey team has discovered an ocean teeming with life beneath the ice of §Y[From.GetName]§!. Our scientists are eager to get a closer look at the capstone species of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere, a gargantuan nautiloid that is kilometers wide."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.2.name:0 "Fascinating Nautiloids"
 mem_shapes_under_ice.2.desc:0 "After further study and many under-ice expeditions, the crew of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! have discovered a few fascinating things about the nautiloids. Firstly, they have biological processes which create incredibly tough materials for their shells, perfect for construction. However, this would require killing them to obtain the materials. This possibility is made unappealing by the fact the nautiloids also demonstrate basic levels of intelligence, similar to most semi-sentient species. In addition, when not keeping themselves afloat, they drop down into the depths quickly, making harvesting the dead impossible unless teams are present at the moment of death. This means that we will have to actively slaughter the creatures if we wish to recover their shells."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.2.a:0 "Our biologists would be thrilled to study these creatures."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.2.b:0 "Though it pains us, their loss is our gain."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.2.phile:0 "Let's see how intelligent they are. Try to establish communications."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.2.mat:0 "Even if we don't harvest them, we can study the shells of live ones."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.99.name:0 "Dirty Viewport"
 mem_shapes_under_ice.99.desc:0 "Further investigation of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! indicates that the shifting dark spots are not from the planet at all, but rather from a pressure leak causing optical flaws in the §Y[Root.GetName]§!'s viewports. Engineering teams have fixed the faulty pressure valve, and there is nothing more of interest to be found here."
 mem_shapes_under_ice.99.a:0 "Disappointing."
