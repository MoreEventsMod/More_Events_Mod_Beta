 r_mem_xaal_engine: "Probabalistic Engine"
 r_mem_xaal_engine_desc: "Mysterious race of Xaal has created this device to enhance their natural reality-warping powers. For us, its effects limited, but still we can change reality around ourselves to be more favourable to us. Probably."
 mem_xaal_engine_active_effect: "Probabalistic Enhancement"
 mem_xaal_engine_edict_enabled: "Planetary Destiny Can Be Edited"
 mem_xaal_engine_edict_enabled_desc: "We can use a decision to change the fate of one of the inhabitable planets in our space. It must not already have occupants or have a particularly profound past for this effect to work."
 mem_xaal_engine_effect_tooltip: "Unlocks §S$decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine$§! decision. (Single use on unowned habitable planet in our space per relic activation. Not stackable.)"
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine: "Edit Planetary Destiny"
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine_desc: "We can change the past of this planet. Or, perhaps, its future. It can't be known what will actually happen. But it's going to be great. Perhaps."
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine_rich_history: "This planet's history is too rich for this effect to work."
 decision_mem_xaal_already_applied: "We have already edited this planet's destiny."
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine_effect: "Planet will change in various unpredictable way. Or possibly won't."

 d_mem_xaal_probabilistic_colony: "Probabalistic Warp"
 d_mem_xaal_probabilistic_colony_desc: "This planet is somehow more favourable than it should be."

 
 mem_xaal.1.name: "[From.GetName] Experineces a Climate Change"
 mem_xaal.1.desc.cold: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nIt seems that another version of it was pulled into existence, resulting in signficant reduction of surface temperature. Overnight the climate and ecosystem became completely different."
 mem_xaal.1.desc.dry: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nIt seems that another version of it was pulled into existence, resulting in signficant rise of surface temperature and great decrease in humidity. Overnight the climate and ecosystem became completely different."
 mem_xaal.1.desc.wet: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nIt seems that another version of it was pulled into existence, and along with it a great amount of water, increasing humidity quite significantly. Overnight the climate and ecosystem became completely different."
 mem_xaal.1.desc.gaia: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nSomehow, condition on the surface improved signficantly, making a planet much more favorable for all forms of life. A new ecosystem florished overnight."
 mem_xaal.2.name: "[From.GetName] Turns Into a Relic World"
 mem_xaal.2.desc: "§Y[From.GetName]§! has undergone a startling transformation after the application of the Probabalistic Engine. In an instant, an alien civilisation appeared on its surface, advanced to the apex of its creation and perished. \n\nOvernight, the planet turned into an endless expanse of millenia-old ruins, as if they were always there."
 mem_xaal.2.a: "Impressive."
 mem_xaal.2.a.phile: "Shame we didn't get to meet..."
 mem_xaal.3.name: "[From.GetName] Becomes Shielded"
 mem_xaal.3.desc: "After using Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! we have observed an usual event. Somehow the [From.GetPlanetMoon] became encased in an inpregnable energy shield. \n\nIt looks like we have willed a civilisation into being, except some hostile force encased their homeworld inside a forcefield trapping them forever."
 mem_xaal.3.a: "How odd."
 mem_xaal.3.a.phile: "Wish we could meet those who lived there."
 mem_xaal.3.a.phobe: "They probably had it coming."
 mem_xaal.4.name: "[From.GetName] Shattered"
 mem_xaal.4.desc: "After using Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! we have observed an usual event. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] shattered in an instant, as if someone blew it. \n\nPerhaps, in another reality it was us. Or perhaps some unseen enemy other version of us was fighting. Or maybe it was a natural force."
 mem_xaal.5.name: "[From.GetName] Phased Out of Reality"
 mem_xaal.5.desc: "It seems our attempt to use Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! was not entirely successful. \n\nThe [From.GetPlanetMoon] is now stuck between realities somehow, in a constant state of flux."
 mem_xaal.5.a: "Strange..."
 mem_xaal.6.name: "A New Species Appears on [From.GetName]"
 mem_xaal.6.desc: "After we used the Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! it has minor, but noticable effect on planetary ecosystem. It seems a new life form had retroactively evolved on the planet's surface, seamlessly integrating into the ecosystem. The species is not sapient, but has potential to become ones."
 mem_xaal.7.name: "[From.Owner.GetName] Appears on [From.GetName]"
 mem_xaal.7.desc: "After we used the Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! it seems to have completely altered the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s history. \n\nAn entire new species have taken presence on the surface, building up a civilisation that never was here before. They seem to be completely unaware that they were phased into existence overnight."
 mem_xaal.8.name: "[From.GetName] Destroyed in Nuclear War"
 mem_xaal.8.desc: "After we used the Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! we have observed a series of high-power explosions on planet's surface, as if massive exchange of nuclear strikes occured. \n\nThe planet is now expeiences a nuclear winter, its surface devastated."
 mem_xaal.8.a: "Unfortunate."
 mem_xaal.8.a.phile: "How tragic."
 mem_xaal.8.a.phobe: "At least it didn't bring in any living xenos."
 mem_xaal.9.name: "[colony_species.GetAdj] Colony on [From.GetName]"
 mem_xaal.9.desc: "After we used the Probabalistic Engine on §Y[From.GetName]§! we instantly started receiving datastreams from the surface. It seems that we have willed an alterante version of this [From.GetPlanetMoon] where we have already established a colony on the surface some time ago."
 mem_xaal.9.a: "How convenient."
 mem_xaal.10.name: "Loot Scattered on [From.GetName]"
 mem_xaal.10.desc: "After activating Probabalistic Engine on [From.GetName] we did not observe any profound changes. However, we have detected minor artefacts scattered across the surface, left by some unknown passer-bys in a different reality."
 mem_xaal.10.a: "How lucky."
 mem_xaal.11.name: "Nothing Happens"
 mem_xaal.11.desc: "[From.GetName] did not seem to be affected by the Probabalistic Engine at all. There's no perceptible changes on surface."
 mem_xaal.11.a: "Disappointing."
