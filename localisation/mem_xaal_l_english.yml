 r_mem_xaal_engine: "Probabalistic Engine"
 r_mem_xaal_engine_desc: "Mysterious race of Xaal has created this device to enhance their natural reality-warping powers. For us, its effects limited, but still we can change reality around ourselves to be more favourable to us. Probably."
 mem_xaal_engine_active_effect: "Probabalistic Enhancement"
 mem_xaal_engine_edict_enabled: "Planetary Destiny Can Be Edited"
 mem_xaal_engine_edict_enabled_desc: "We can use a decision to change the fate of one of the inhabitable planets in our space. It must not already have occupants or have a particularly profound past for this effect to work."
 mem_xaal_engine_effect_tooltip: "Unlocks §S$decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine$§! decision. (Single use on unowned habitable planet in our space per relic activation. Not stackable.)"
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine: "Edit Planetary Destiny"
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine_desc: "We can change the past of this planet. Or, perhaps, its future. It can't be known what will actually happen. But it's going to be great. Perhaps."
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine_rich_history: "This planet's history is too rich for this effect to work."
 decision_mem_xaal_already_applied: "We have already edited this planet's destiny."
 decision_mem_xaal_activate_the_engine_effect: "Planet will change in various unpredictable way. Or possibly won't."

 d_mem_xaal_probabilistic_colony: "Probabalistic Warp"
 d_mem_xaal_probabilistic_colony_desc: "This planet is somehow more favourable than it should be."

 
 mem_xaal.1.name: "[From.GetName] Experineces a Climate Change"
 mem_xaal.1.desc.cold: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nIt seems that another version of it was pulled into existence, resulting in signficant reduction of surface temperature. Overnight the climate and ecosystem became completely different."
 mem_xaal.1.desc.dry: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nIt seems that another version of it was pulled into existence, resulting in signficant rise of surface temperature and great decrease in humidity. Overnight the climate and ecosystem became completely different."
 mem_xaal.1.desc.wet: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nIt seems that another version of it was pulled into existence, and along with it a great amount of water, increasing humidity quite significantly. Overnight the climate and ecosystem became completely different."
 mem_xaal.1.desc.gaia: "The application of probabalistic engine had a profound effect on §Y[From.GetName]§!'s climate. \n\nSomehow, condition on the surface improved signficantly, making a planet much more favorable for all forms of life. A new ecosystem florished overnight."
