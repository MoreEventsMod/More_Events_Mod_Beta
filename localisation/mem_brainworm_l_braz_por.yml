 mem_brainworm_category:0 "Strange Biosphere"
 mem_brainworm_category_desc:0 "Orbital surveys shows a dense and active biosphere on §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 
 mem_brainworm.1.name:0 "Strange Biosphere Analysed"
 mem_brainworm.1.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§! is unlike anything predicted our the xenobiologists. Additional resources are requested to fully study the dense biosphere and collect samples for more detailed examinations beyond the capabilities of our remote probes."
 mem_brainworm.2.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has returned to §Y[Root.GetName]§! from the surface with a large number of exotic flora and fauna for our scientists to study. This work will greatly expand our knowledge of xenobiology."
 mem_brainworm.501.name:0 "Conspiracy Theorists Arrested"
 mem_brainworm.501.desc:0 "A group of citizens have been spreading rumours that the leadership of our country has been infiltrated by aliens in disguise! Our security forces have arrested the leading rumour mongers and request instructions on how to deal with them."
 mem_brainworm.501.a:0 "Make an example of them."
 mem_brainworm.501.b:0 "Who will believe such nonsense? Release them."
 mem_brainworm.501.c:0 "What if they are right..."
 mem_brainworm.5011.name:0 "Conspiracy Theorists Executed"
 mem_brainworm.5011.desc:0 "The malcontents spreading the rumours of alien infiltration have been executed. All public discussion of their theory has ended."
 mem_brainworm.5011.a:0 "So die all traitors."
 mem_brainworm.5012.name:0 "Conspiracy Theorists Released"
 mem_brainworm.5012.desc:0 "The conspiracy theorists who have been spreading the rumours that aliens have infiltrated the government have been released. Our monitoring shows that, while they continue spreading their lies, most citizens view them as fringe crazies and do not believe them."
 mem_brainworm.5012.a:0 "Those poor, deluded fools."
 mem_brainworm.5013.name:0 "Conspiracy Investigation Report"
 mem_brainworm.5013.desc:0 "Our security services have taken detailed reports of the accusations from the arrested conspiracy theorists and investigated them thoroughly. No evidence of alien infiltration has been found. The theorists are now accusing the investigators of being secret aliens covering up the conspiracy."
 mem_brainworm.5013.a:0 "What a waste of time!"
 mem_brainworm.5014.name:0 "Conspiracy Investigation Report"
 mem_brainworm.5014.desc:0 "Our security services were forced to kill one of our leading bureaucrats after they became violent during the investigation. An autopsy of the body discovered a wormlike parasite embedded in their brain. Immediate study by our scientists is recommended to determine what this worm is."
 mem_brainworm.5014.a:0 "I knew it!"
 mem_brainworm.502.name:0 "Smuggling Ship Destroyed"
 mem_brainworm.502.desc:0 "A smuggling ship was intercepted by a routine patrol. Before it could be boarded, however, the smugglers overheated their engines and destroyed the ship. This is strange behaviour for smugglers, though our security forces are unsure what it may mean."
 mem_brainworm.503.name:0 "Illegal Lab Raided"
 mem_brainworm.503.desc:0 "Our security forces have discovered an illegal medical lab and raided it. Unfortunately, whoever was running it must have been tipped off, as they cleared out before security arrived. Whatever they were doing, this is probably not the last we will hear of it."
 mem_brainworm.504.name:0 "Strange Parasite Discovered"
 mem_brainworm.504.desc:0 "One of our senior officials passed away recently. During a routine autopsy, we discovered a strange parasitic worm in their brain, one that our medical staff claims to have never seen before. We must study this creature immediately to determine its threat to our society."
 mem_brainworm.504.a:0 "What could it be?"
 mem_brainworm.6.name:0 "The Ephialtes Worm"
 mem_brainworm.6.desc:0 "Despite attempted sabotage, our scientists have determined that the parasite they are now calling the Ephialtes Worm is an insidious xeno creature that hijacks the mind of any creature whose brain it can burrow into. Once it enters the brain, the worm extends tendrils that allow it to control the unfortunate creature and destroy its free will. Who knows how long this infiltration has been going on and how many of our people are hosts for this parasite?"
 mem_brainworm.6.a:0 "Our very souls are at risk!"
 mem_brainworm.6.b:0 "We will fight this threat with all our might!"
 mem_brainworm.6.c:0 "Science will allow us to defeat this threat!"
 mem_brainworm.6.d:0 "We shall save our people from this threat!"
 mem_brainworm.6.e:0 "This threat must be defeated!"
 mem_brainworm.6.f:0 "No worm will defeat us!"
 mem_brainworm.6.g:0 "No xenos may corrupt our purity!"
 mem_brainworm.6.h:0 "What a fascinating creature..."
 mem_brainworm.6.i:0 "If only we had such control over our citizens' minds..."
 mem_brainworm.6.j:0 "These worms steal our free will!"
 mem_brainworm.6.k:0 "No worm will take my mind!"
 mem_brainworm.7.name:0 "The Ephialtes Worm Insurrection"
 mem_brainworm.7.desc:0 "Their plot to secretly turn us all into slaves having failed, the Worms are now striking against us openly. High ranking members of the leadership have vanished, our ships are being sabotaged, and enthralled populations are rising up in an attempt to seize control of entire planets."
 mem_brainworm.7.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
 
 BRAINWORM_EXPEDITION_PROJECT:0 "Study Biosphere"
 BRAINWORM_EXPEDITION_PROJECT_DESC:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! has an unusually active biosphere with flora and fauna unlike anything our scientists have seen on similar worlds. Orbital observation has been deemed insufficient to fully study §Y[From.GetName]§! and a landing expedition has been requested."
 BRAINWORM_INFILTRATION_PROJECT:0 "Investigate Alien Parasites"
 BRAINWORM_INFILTRATION_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our internal security services have found a strange alien parasite embedded in the brain of one of our leading officials. What it was doing there and what effects it has on the host must be investigated immediately for the security of our society."
 ephialtes_worm_chain_title:0 "The Ephialtes Worm"
 ephialtes_worm_chain_desc:0 "Our society has been infiltrated by a parasitic worm that takes over the mind of its host. We must save ourselves or become slaves to the Worm."
 
 mem_brainworm.101.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that further study of the biosphere of §Y[From.GetName]§! have shown no unusual activity. The initial readings were the result of poorly calibrated sensors. The problem has been fixed."
 mem_brainworm.102.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that further study of the biosphere of §Y[From.GetName]§! have shown no unusual activity. The initial readings were the result of poorly calibrated sensors. The problem has been fixed."
