 mem_duel_ritual.4.desc:0 "Although most of the populace of §Y[This.GetName]§! has come to terms with their new lot in life, a particularly militaristic faction has been stirring up unrest at their loss of independence. There have already been multiple incidents of natives refusing to follow our authorities' orders or even outright our occupying forces."
 mem_duel_ritual.4.a:0 "This is merely a passing phase."
 mem_duel_ritual.4.b:0 "They seem to be under the misconception that they have a choice."

 # Audience Duel proposal
 mem_duel_ritual.6.name:0 "Archaic Rituals"
 mem_duel_ritual.6.desc:0 "The representative explains: "The people of §Y[This.GetName]§! have a long tradition of settling social matters such as this through the means of honour duels. Representatives of our two peoples would engage in combat armed with only primitive weapons. Although these duels are mostly symbolic, this symbolism is of great importance to our people.\n\nIf you accept this proposal, all hostilities will cease immediately until the ritual is over. What do you say?""
 mem_duel_ritual.6.a:0 "We accept. General [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] will be our champion."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.a.tooltip:0 "General §Y[mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName]§! "volunteers" to act as your champion in the duel."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.a.response:0 ""It is settled then. Your champion will face ours in a month from now."\n\nBoth combatants will take this time to prepare. It is unlikely that this highly ritualised duel will prove fatal to either, but accidents do happen..."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.b:0 "We accept. A member of our special forces will be our champion."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.b.tooltip:0 "A volunteer from the special forces division will act as your champion in the duel."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.c:0 "We will not participate in this archaic ritual."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.c.tooltip:0 "As a result of your refusal to honour their customs, all primitive pops on §Y[This.GetName]§! will get a stronger version of the §YForeign Occupation§! Modifier, reducing their happiness by 20% for five years."
 mem_duel_ritual.6.c.response:0 ""This is outrageous! Our people will never accept your rule while you utterly disregard our traditions!"\n\nThe representative storms out of the room..."

Whether our race will leave stains there too is yet to be seen.\n\nBefore [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetHisHer] current commanding position, General [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] was a member of our special forces, with over 300 confirmed kills. As a former expert in guerilla warfare, [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetSheHe] [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetIsAre] no stranger to melee combat.

 mem_duel_ritual.8.desc:0 "General [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] is victorious! This battle was decided almost from the first blow, which struck the other champion to the ground.

 mem_duel_ritual.9.desc:0 "As both combatants closed upon one another, general [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetName] and [mem_duel_ritual_champion.GetHisHer] opponent tripped over their own appendages, knocking themselves unconscious on a rock on the ground. On the bright side, the militant movement that started all this trouble seems to have fizzled out due to a complete inability to comprehend what just happened. The rest of the galaxy comprehends well enough though, their mocking laughter echoing through our ears. The general's pride will never recover, and with good reason."
 mem_duel_ritual.9.a:0 "We are the laughing stock of the galaxy!"
