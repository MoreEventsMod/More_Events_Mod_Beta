 mem_borehole_category:0 "Hole in the Ground"
 mem_borehole_category_desc:0 "Surface imaging revealed a long vertical shaft in the planet's crust. The precise, right angles and unusually smooth surface suggest an artificial origin."
  
 mem_borehole.1.name:0 "Abandoned Deep Mine"
 mem_borehole.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the installation is some kind of mine designed to extract minerals from the deeper levels of the planet's crust. The mine is currently deactivated, and with minimal repairs, it can be brought back online."
 mem_borehole.1a:0 "Repair the borehole equipment."
 mem_borehole.1b:0 "Disassemble the equipment to learn about its secrets."
 mem_borehole.1c:0 "Salvage the borehole equipment."
 
 mem_borehole.2.name:0 "Rare Minerals Survey"
 mem_borehole.2.desc:0 "It appears the shaft was designed to breach a large deposit of rare ore. However, just as the miners reached that deposit, the project was abandoned for unknown reasons."
 mem_borehole.2a:0 "We should study their findings."
 mem_borehole.2b:0 "Looks like they found garanthium."
 
 mem_borehole.3.name:0 "Missile Silo"
 mem_borehole.3.desc:0 "At the bottom of the mine, our science team found an enormous rocket outfitted with the biggest thermonuclear warhead ever recorded. [Root.GetLeaderName], however, suggests that this is not, in fact, a weapon, but a novelty project of some kind, since its mass, material composition and structure means it is impossible for it to fly, let alone achieve escape velocity, without falling apart. Some of the design choices are still very interesting, however."
 mem_borehole.3a:0 "We should study the rocket."
 
 mem_borehole.4.name:0 "A Habitat"
 mem_borehole.4.desc:0 "On inspection, the shaft's walls were found to be composed of thousands of small, self-sustaining pods outfitted with life-support systems. Most of them were either scrubbed clean or never inhabited to begin with, but some still have items scattered inside, suggesting the inhabitants had left in a hurry. The unusual architectural design of the pods could be a subject for an interesting study."
 mem_borehole.4a:0 "We should look into it."
 
 mem_borehole.5.name:0 "Sludge Deposit"
 mem_borehole.5.desc:0 "The initial observation showed that the shaft is almost entirely filled with a high-energy radioactive sludge. It was likely a dumping site for another civilization's industrial pollution. [Root.GetLeaderName] refuses to advance further, citing [Leader.GetHerHis] lack of faith in our hazardous material protection technology's ability to save [Leader.GetHerHim] and [Leader.GetHerHis] team from this "crime against nature.""
 mem_borehole.5a:0 "Disgusting. But interesting."
 
 mem_borehole.6.name:0 "Race To The Bottom"
 mem_borehole.6.desc:0 "The science team examined the borehole. Judging by the wall's texture, it was carved with a powerful laser installation and appears to have reached the planet's molten core without striking any particularly useful deposit. Nearby, [Root.GetLeaderName] located a small transmitter that has long since ran out of energy. Preliminary analysis of its databanks suggests it was meant to broadcast a message on repeat across the galaxy, bragging about reaching the planet's molten core ahead of competitors."
 mem_borehole.6a:0 "Congratulations, probably."
 
 mem_borehole.7.name:0 "Nothing of Value Found"
 mem_borehole.7.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] reports that while the shaft is definitely an artificial borehole, it was scraped clean, with no useful technology or mineral deposits to be recovered."
 
 mem_borehole.8.name:0 "It's A Trap!"
 mem_borehole.8.desc:0 "While exploring the borehole on [From.GetName], §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! apparently triggered some kind of booby trap, causing the entire structure to collapse, killing [Leader.GetHerHim] and most of [Leader.GetHerHis] team."
