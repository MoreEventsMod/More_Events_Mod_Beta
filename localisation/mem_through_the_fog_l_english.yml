 mem_through_the_fog_dig_site_desc: "The surface of this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is covered by decaying ruins of abandoned cities hidden by thick toxic fog. Elevated electrical activity in the atmosphere makes it difficult to study them from orbit, but shielding equipment should allow us to explore the surface safely."
 
 mem_through_the_fog.1.name: "Zomarr Ruins"
 mem_through_the_fog.1.desc: "Archaeological research on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! confirmed that ruins on the planet belong to an extinct species that called themselves §SZomarr§!. \n\nUnlike most, they did not seem to be interested in space travel and never discovered the hyperlane network, and developed impressive technologies while almost never leaving vicinity of their home world. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! names §Snanotechnologies§! as their primary area of expertise. \n\nIt seem they have been wiped out when another massive body, such as an asteroid or a comet collided with the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] rendering it uninhabitable, yet very few bodies are found outside of designated burial grounds - much fewer than expected in case of massive disaster like this."
 mem_through_the_fog.2.name: "Portent of Doom"
 mem_through_the_fog.2.desc: "It appears the Zomarr obsessively made and maintained low-tech hard copies of their news publications, fearing tampering and disruption. Some of those storages are still standing, and §Y[Leader.GetName]§! was able to reconstruct parts of the events leading to downfall of their civilisation. \n\nLarge number of reports concern \"§SPortent of Doom§!\" - a massive comet on a collision course with [From.Planet.GetName]. Zomarr leadership has revealed existence of a secret project prepared for extinction-level event, but exact nature of the event is unclear for now. The leading nanotechnology experts were apparently called in to contribute to it."
 
 mem_through_the_fog.3.name: "The Cloudminder Project"
 mem_through_the_fog.3.desc: "Following information recovered from the archives, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! was able to locate one of the facilities where research aiming to save the Zomarr from extinction. Codenamed \"§SProject Cloudminder§!\" it appears to be related to nanite swarms in some way, but it's unclear what exactly was the goal. The project was completed shortly before the impact, and most of it abandoned unsecured, seeing as there was no reason to backup anything in light of impending doom. "
 
 mem_through_the_fog.4.name: "The Zomarr Live!"
 mem_through_the_fog.4.desc: "After an extensive studies, archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! confirmed what was long suspected. The Zomarr have survived the impact event that destroyed their planet, but not in a form one would recognize. \n\nAfter an extensive sensor calibration, it became apparent that the air is now saturated with nanites, and each contains a piece of Zomarr mind. In anticipation of impact, Zomarr authorities have distributed a sample of new type of nanomachines for citizens to inject themselves with. While few refused, most had their brains scanned and bodies disassembled into nanite swarms, each capable of maintaining a Zomarr mind it consumed. This way they survived the devastation of their world. \n\nEver since we stepped on the planet, they tried to communicate, although due to power requirements, most remain dormant and only a few are active at any given time. Most of the key personnel had to stay in corporeal form to ensure successful transformation, so we are unlikely to find sufficient data to replicate this process. However, the very possibility of such an existence is fascinating."
 mem_through_the_fog.4.a: "Use EMP generators to destroy the nanites."
