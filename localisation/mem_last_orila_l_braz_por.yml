 mem_last_orila_1_chain_desc:0 "Aeons ago, the Orila fleet was lured into a trap. Their enemies collapsed the star the fleet was orbiting, ripping apart the Orila ships with an enormous explosion.\n\nChap'Lin himself, the then commanding officer of the Orila flagship, was among the few survivors. Every other ship in the fleet was completely obliterated, but the 'Pride of Harilla', though heavily damaged, survived the blast. The survivors were nevertheless forced to abandon ship, which has remained unrecovered to this day.\n\nThe loss of the fleet devastated the Orila nation. They were baffled as to how their technologically inferior foes had been able to collapse an entire star. As their civilization unravelled, the Orila could only assume that it must have been the work of an outside agent, yet their last bastion fell before any proof was found.\n\nWith the Orila effectively extinct, the true cause of the stellar collapse remains a mystery. But the wreckage might still be there. If we were to recover and restore it, it would surely aid our cause."
 
 mem_last_orila_2_chain_title:0 "A Pride Long Lost"
 mem_last_orila_2_chain_desc:0 "We have found the wreckage of the 'Pride of Harilla'. While studying it, a fleet of pirate ships attacked our research team. According to Chap'Lin the ship's energy core is missing. Given their aggressive behaviour, these pirates must have recognized the value of this wreckage and already begun scavenging it for advanced technology. Our only hope to find the missing energy core lies in tracing the pirates back to their home base."

 # Chap'Lin messages the player after some time has passed
 mem_last_orila.1.name:0 "The Lost Fleet"
 mem_last_orila.1.desc:0 "A message from Chap'Lin has arrived. His studies of our database to validate his own mostly outdated information seems to have progressed well.\n\nOne of the results of the data synchronization has been deemed by him of special interest for the [root.GetName]. According to him, the coordinates attached to this message might lead us to where the decisive defeat and ultimately the demise of the Orila took place.\n\nMore detailed information will be available in the situation log."
 mem_last_orila.1.a:0 "We should go there."
 
 # Arrival in the system where the wreckage is
 mem_last_orila.2.name:0 "Arrival at Philos Sigma"
 mem_last_orila.2.desc:0 "We have arrived in the Philos Sigma system -- the place where the fate of the Orila was sealed aeons ago.\n\nThe [root.GetName]'s central bridge monitor shows a magnified view of what appears to be a debris field and a large wreckage in front of the black hole's menacing maw. Luckily, according to our sensors, it is still within a safe distance of it.\n\nA project to investigate our finding has been added to the situation log."

 mem_last_orila.3.name:0 "Unidentified Fleet Approaches"
 mem_last_orila.3.desc:0 "An unidentified fleet has jumped into the system. It is approaching the Orila wreckage and is blocking all communications. We must assume they are hostile.\n\nWe cannot risk letting the ancient technology fall into someone else's hands."
 mem_last_orila.3.a:0 "Send our fleet to intercept them."
 
 # Completed project to investigate wreckage, new system spawned filled with pirates and stolen energy core
 mem_last_orila.5.name:0 "The Missing Core"
 mem_last_orila.5.desc:0 "Our investigation of the wreckage has revealed that we are not the first to lay their hands on it. According to Chap'Lin, a vital part of the ship is missing -- the reactor module.\n\nFortunately, we were able to track down the origin of the pirates we fought prior to the investigation by extrapolating their incoming vector. We can only hope that they were responsible for removing the reactor module in the first place."

Unfortunately, this system is heavily fortified, and diplomacy seems not to be an option considering our prior encounters with these outlaws."

Despite its age, the module does appear to be in good shape considering the circumstances. We should be able to connect it to Chap'Lin's vessel now."

 mem_last_orila.15.desc:0 "The 'Pride of Harilla' is finally repaired, or at least so it appeared at first. Chap'Lin explains that even though the repairs were successful, many of the ship's systems are running at suboptimal levels. Even with his extensive knowledge, it might take years to adjust to the rather primitive fixes done to the ancient technology and unlock the full potential of the ship in its new form. He begs his leave while mentioning that he is in the middle of some calibrations."
