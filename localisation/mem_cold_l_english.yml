 mem_cold_dig_site: "Cold Comfort"
 mem_cold_dig_site_desc: "The surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is extremely cold, much colder than expected based on its postion in the system. Even though it's uninhabitable now, decaying ruins of an industrial civilization are scattered across the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] suggesting relatively recent and extremely drastic climate change."

 mem_cold.1.name: "The Dead World"
 mem_cold.1.desc: "Archaeological studies on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! decisively confirm the initial observations from the orbit - the planet was, indeed, at some point a home to sapient organic life - a large mammalian species who called themseves §SHoreef§!. The technology level is decisively pre-spaceflight; at the time of their destructuction the natives were undergoing industrialization and technological progress. The process was hampered somewhat by limited supply of energy - the planet didn't have sufficient amount of fossil fuel or fissable materials. \n\nDespite having access to weapon of mass destruction, the Horeef didn't destroy themselves in an apocalyptic war, neither there's any indication of civil unrest or invasion from space. However, there's definitely something wrong with the planet, ranging from unusual pattern of decay in buildings, remains and soil to ionizing radiation coming from uncertain source. \n\nIt remains a mystery what destroyed their civilization - as if all life on the planet was snuffed out in overnight. If it was a weapon - it's nothing we previously encountered."
 mem_cold.2.name: "State of Decay"
 mem_cold.2.desc: "The more §Y[Leader.GetName]§! and [Leader.GetHerHis] expedition explored the ruins of Horeef civilization, the more strange occurences they cam across. \n\nThe radiation detected earlier doesn't come from any kind of contamination by radioactive materials - instead stable isotopes, with half-life in millions of years are decaying at vastly increased speed - enough to be detected by standard radiological equipment. Complex compounds are measurably decomposing in ways inconsistent with any chemical process we could expect to happen at freezing temperatures. Even the starry sky seem dimmer somehow when oserved from the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThis phenomena are spreading radially from a spot on one of the larger landmasses. This would likely be a source."
 mem_cold.3.name: "The Sky Razor Project"
 mem_cold.3.desc: "The exploration of the origin point of the strange anomalies that plague §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has proven to be perilous and fruitless - the area itself has mostly turned into radiactive shifting sand. However, data from there was transferred to remote locations for backup, and some of those are still usable. \n\nAs established earlier, the Horeef struggled with energy shortages to sustain their civilization, and to combat this they started a project codenamed §SSky Razor§!. They were hoping to discover an unlimited source of energy by opening some sort of dimensional rift and syphoning it from another universe. \n\nThe facility where research was conducted worked and sent reports up until the disaster that destroyed the Horeef civilization, but from the look of it, they were not successful. In fact, according to §Y[Leader.GetName]§!, they weren't even close to any kind of working prototype - their research was complete nonsense. \n\nThis means it's highly unlikely Sky Razor is responsible for planet's destruction. Yet, there's obviously a link."
 mem_cold.4.name: "A Hole in the World"
 mem_cold.4.desc: "Further measurements taken at the site of former Sky Razor facility, extensive research and studying the reports lead §Y[Leader.GetName]§! to conclusion that the Horeef were not responsible for their destruction. Someone else was. \n\nThe Sky Razor researchers were not even close to opening any kind of rift, that much is clear, but it seems someone, in a different universe, likely the alternate universe version of Horeef did. Their equivalent of Sky Razor was successful and tapped into our universe for unlimited supply of energy by creating a rift on the very same spot Sky Razor facility stood. The initial opening caused large amount of energy to be syphoned from the local space - and that included heat and energy of chemical and nuclear bonds. The matter was ripped apart - most devastatingly at the site of Sky Razor, less so, but still fatal to all forms life and caused massive drop in temperature. \n\nThe flow of energy slowed down since, but remains a constant drain, with rift continuing to syphon energy from the planet. Unfortunately there's nothing we can do to collapse the rift from our side or contact the other - that's assuming anyone is still artificially keeping the rift open and it's not a self-sustaining runaway process. \n\nOn the other as long as we steer clear from the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we would not experience any negative effect, as drain strength decreases exponentially. If this process continues, the life cycle of §Y[From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! star will be shortened by merely a few thousands years and heat death of the universe will come about a decade sooner. Hardly something to worry about."
 mem_cold.4.a: "This is still troubling."
