 mem_into_the_woods_beacon: "Quarantine Beacons"
 mem_into_the_woods_beacon_desc: "Satellites orbiting the planet transmit a simple and clear message: §S\"Do not land. Extreme danger.\"§!"

 mem_into_the_woods_dig_site: "Into the Woods"
 mem_into_the_woods_dig_site_desc: "Several satellites are still in orbit, broadcasting a warning for all passing ships to not land on the planet. \n\nRuined buildings can be seen scattered throughout the forested areas of the planet. The nature tried very hard to reclaim them but is yet to succeed entirely. No advanced forms of life have been detected there - whoever built those cities has either left or died out."
 mem_into_the_woods.1.name: "The Qzell Colony"
 mem_into_the_woods.1.desc: "The first results from the dig site on [From.Planet.GetName] are coming in. It appears that the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was colonized by a reptilian species known as §SQzell§! that was active in this region of space around 1000 years ago. \n\nThe colony itself was in the early stages of development when it was abruptly abandoned. There's no evidence of attack or disaster of any kind - it's as if one day the Qzell colony just collapsed for no reason."
 mem_into_the_woods.2.name: "Impact Studies"
 mem_into_the_woods.2.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has located an intact data core and was able to recover a report from the early days of Qzell colonization efforts on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nQzell scientists were tracking the environmental impact from construction, land clearing and the introduction of their native plants. It seems the impact they made significantly exceeded their projections, with several species like \"bloboids\" and \"lungbeetles\" already going extinct."
 mem_into_the_woods.3.name: "Medical Facilities"
 mem_into_the_woods.3.desc: "Our expedition to [From.Planet.GetName] has identified medical facilities in some of the colonial towns. From the look of it, the Qzell had quite a problem with their colonists' mental health. [Leader.GetName] reports extensive records idiopathic hallucinations, delusions and nervous breakdowns which Qzell science could not explain. There didn't seem anything to be wrong with the colonists physically, yet a full quarter of them were afflicted in some way, threatening the functioning of the colony. "
 mem_into_the_woods.4.name: "The Madness"
 mem_into_the_woods.4.desc: "After an extensive survey of the ruins of the Qzell colony on [From.Planet.GetName], it seems that the majority of the colonists succumbed to moss psychosis. Those who did not fled the planet, declaring it a quarantine area, still ignorant of the cause and leaving raving lunatics behind to starve or kill each other. \n\nThose left behind were too busy engaging in self-mutilation and cannibalism to properly record anything, although some left semi-coherent recordings and scrawling on the walls, talking about something called the §SOld Growth§! and praising its majesty. Unfortunately, there is no indication what the Old Growth could possibly be, though perhaps continued exploration could shed some light on it."
 mem_into_the_woods.4.a: "We need to find out what it was."
 mem_into_the_woods.5.name: "The Old Growth"
 mem_into_the_woods.5.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports successfully figuring out what the mysterious §SOld Growth§! that drove the Qzell colonists on [From.Planet.GetName] mad was - and indeed discovering its remains. The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was once infested by a single fungoid superorganism that penetrated the majority of its vegetation, stretching across all verdant landmasses, connecting them via tendrils that reached under the seas. The natural neural network possessed a consciousness of a sort and symbiotically exchanged data with other life forms through process that aren't quite understood yet. Although its genetic makeup suggests it didn't evolve on [From.Planet.GetName] originally, it has spent millions of years maintaining a symbiotic relationship with the native life. \n\nWhen Qzell colonists arrived, they carelessly disrupted the ecosystem, causing the extinction of some of the most sensitive creatures attuned to the Old Growth. In turn, the Old Growth turned its attention to the new arrival, trying to offload its accumulated knowledge onto them, but for some reason the Qzell were not as receptive as the native lifeforms. The interference of the mangled thoughts of a millennia-old mushroom gradually drove them mad, resulting in the collapse of the colony. \n\nThe unique biological neural network the §SOld Growth§! does not have capacity to forget anything without first transferring it elsewhere, and without a suitable host to unload the excess thoughts and knowledge onto, it became overwhelmed and grew sick. Its tendrils withered and died, and what remains alive is a relatively small (yet still massive compared to most planetbound organisms) biomass deposit near the equator. [Leader.GetName] believes it can be safely preserved and nurtured back to health, so that it can be and manipulated to safely exchange information with our population. Or we could extinguish it once and for all."
 mem_into_the_woods.5.a: "Its knowledge could serve us."
 mem_into_the_woods.5.b: "Such vast and ancient wisdom cannot be allowed to perish!"
 mem_into_the_woods.5.c: "New pet! So big! So soft and cuddly!"
 mem_into_the_woods.5.d: "It's too dangerous to exist."
 mem_into_the_woods.5.e: "It must not be allowed to contaminate our purity"
 mem_into_the_woods.5.f: "We shall feast on this rare treat!"
 mem_into_the_woods.5.g: "All thinking organics must be destroyed."
  
 d_mem_into_the_woods_ruins: "Fallen Colony"
 d_mem_into_the_woods_ruins_desc: "Abandoned remains of an ancient colony litter the planet. They need to be explored before anyone can safely work in them."
 mem_into_the_woods_cant_clear_ruin: "Complete the dig site to clear this blocker"
 d_mem_into_the_woods_old_growth: "The Old Growth"
 d_mem_into_the_woods_old_growth_desc: "A millenia-old, sentient fungal growth. Or what is left of it, anyway. Those who spend time close to it are filled with ancient knowledge. \n\nMaintaining a colony on this planet will allow some of our §Sleaders§! to start with an §Yextra trait§!"
 mem_into_the_woods_cant_clear_old_growth: "Old Growth is wise and ancient. Old Growth cannot be removed."
