 mem_visitor.2.name:0 "Impact Event"
 mem_visitor.2.desc:0 "Our observation post over §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! has picked up a heat signature from the planet that matches the profile of atmospheric re-entry followed by impact on the surface. \n\nAn asteroid small enough to slip past our sensors would burn up before hitting the ground, and the fact that the signature shows an impact suggests that this event might not be natural. The impact occurred in a rural area that is sparsely populated, with few major settlements. As a result, the casualty estimate is low to none, and there is a chance we could recover the object without the natives noticing."
 mem_visitor.2a:0 "We should recover it for ourselves."
 mem_visitor.2a.phile:0 "We must recover the object before it contaminates their civilization."
 mem_visitor.2a.phobe:0 "Savages should not be allowed to get this technology."
 mem_visitor.2a.tooltip:0 "The observation outpost crew will attempt to recover the object."
 mem_visitor.2b:0 "We should leave it be."
 mem_visitor.2b.phile:0 "What falls on their planet is theirs to keep."
 mem_visitor.2b.phobe:0 "Ignore that space garbage."
 mem_visitor.2b.tooltip:0 "The observation outpost crew will leave the object for the natives."
 mem_visitor.2c:0 "Sterilize the area before it causes any trouble."
 mem_visitor.2c.tooltip:0 "The observation outpost crew will destroy the object with an orbital strike."
 
 mem_visitor.31.name:0 "Object Secured"
 mem_visitor.31.desc:0 "The covert shuttle dispatched from the observation outpost over §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! successfully landed on the scene with a special team and managed to retrieve the object before any natives arrived to see them. With the small artificial object safely in their hands, they departed unnoticed."
 mem_visitor.31a:0 "Good job."
 mem_visitor.31a.tooltip:0 "The object will be delivered to our homeworld for study."
 
 mem_visitor.32.name:0 "We Are Too Late"
 mem_visitor.32.desc:0 "The team dispatched from the observation outpost over §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! was too late. A group of natives had already made its way to the impact and left with the small unidentified object. To recover it now would expose our personnel to additional danger, and our entire operation to exposure."
 mem_visitor.32a:0 "We should steal it back."
 mem_visitor.32a.tooltip:0 "The observation outpost will dispatch a team to covertly recover the object from the natives."
 mem_visitor.32b:0 "Fine, they can keep it."
 mem_visitor.32b.tooltip:0 "The natives will be allowed to keep the object."
 
 mem_visitor.41.name:0 "Successful Heist"
 mem_visitor.41.desc:0 "Using satellite images, our team successfully infiltrated the location where the natives who found the object had stopped for the night. Our agents successfully stole the object and left unnoticed, without causing harm."
 mem_visitor.41a:0 "Good job."
 
 mem_visitor.42.name:0 "An Unfortunate Incident"
 mem_visitor.42.desc:0 "Our team successfully found the natives who had taken the object to a nearby settlement. However, in our attempt to covertly recover it, our agents were discovered and attacked by the panicked primitives, who were frightened by our alien appearance. \n\nIn the ensuing fight, most of the attackers were stunned and their memories wiped; however, we cannot be sure we have left no witnesses. The object, though, was successfully recovered."
 mem_visitor.42a:0 "At least we got some results."
 mem_visitor.42a.tooltip:0 "The object will be delivered to our homeworld for study, but the natives might take notice of our actions and become more §Ymilitarist§! or §Yxenophobic§!."
 
 mem_visitor.43.name:0 "Bloodbath"
 mem_visitor.43.desc:0 "Our team successfully found the natives who had taken the object to a nearby settlement. However, in our attempt to covertly recover it, our agents were discovered and attacked by the panicked primitives, who were frightened by our alien appearance. \n\nIn the ensuing fight, a large number of attackers were killed, and the rest fled. It will be hard to contain the situation now, with so many surviving witnesses and traces of the carnage. The object, however, was successfully recovered."
 mem_visitor.43a:0 "Most unfortunate."
 mem_visitor.43a.phile:0 "Tragic."
 mem_visitor.43a.phobe:0 "And nothing of value was lost."
 mem_visitor.43a.tooltip:0 "The object will be delivered to our homeworld for study, but the natives will most certainly take notice of our actions and become more §Ymilitarist§! or §Yxenophobic§!."
 
 mem_visitor.44.name:0 "Mission Failed"
 mem_visitor.44.desc:0 " Our team successfully found the natives who had taken the object to a nearby settlement. However, in our attempt to covertly recover it, our agents were discovered and attacked by the panicked primitives, who were frightened by our alien appearance. \n\nUnwilling to use lethal force against the assailants, the extraction team attempted to flee, resulting in the deaths of multiple agents, the loss of the object, and the potentially disastrous leak of information."
 mem_visitor.44a:0 "This is a disaster."
 mem_visitor.44a.phobe:0 "Was it really worth it?"
 mem_visitor.44a.tooltip:0 "The mission to obtain the object failed, and the natives will likely take notice of our recent actions and become more §Ymilitarist§! or §Yxenophobic§!."
 ##Whoever wrote the above check 44a.tooltip. I think it should be the same as 45a.tooltip
 mem_visitor.45.name:0 "Mission Failed"
 mem_visitor.45.desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the observation post personnel and the recovery team, they have lost track of the object. We will have to wait for it to resurface among the natives."
 mem_visitor.45a:0 "Most unfortunate."
 mem_visitor.45a.tooltip:0 "We will have to wait and see if the object resurfaces again."
 
 mem_visitor.5.name:0 "Sterilization"
 mem_visitor.5.desc:0 "A shuttle deployed from our observation post has deployed a medium-yield missile from a high altitude. It hit the impact site directly. After the dust settled, our surveillance was no longer able to pick up any foreign object on site, and with any luck we should be able to pass this event off as a second meteorite strike in the same spot."
 mem_visitor.5a:0 "That can happen, right?"
 mem_visitor.5a.tooltip:0 "The natives may or may not take notice of our actions."
 
 mem_visitor.52.name:0 "Sterilization Aftermath: Religious Development"
 mem_visitor.52.desc:0 "Our actions on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! were noticed by the natives. Many took the double detonation to be a divine sign and multiple places of worship have popped up on the edges of the crater. Several religious cults based on the event are spreading across the planet."
 mem_visitor.52a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_visitor.52a.tooltip:0 "Our actions have caused natives to become more §Yspiritualist§!."
 
 mem_visitor.53.name:0 "Sterilization Aftermath: Alien Plot Suspected"
 mem_visitor.53.desc:0 "It seems authorities on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! have identified our actions as an alien incursion. Not knowing the full picture, they are blaming the double detonation on an unknown alien force and are considering major investments in the military to repel the expected invasion."
 mem_visitor.53a:0 "Worrying"
 mem_visitor.53a.phile:0 "What have we done!"
 mem_visitor.53a.tooltip:0 "Natives took notice of our actions and are preparing to defend themselves from future incursions. This will make them more §Ymilitarist§!, §Yxenophobic§! or §Ymaterialist§!."
 
 mem_visitor.54.name:0 "Sterilization Aftermath: Tensions Rising"
 mem_visitor.54.desc:0 "It doesn't seem that authorities on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! suspect any extra-terrestrial involvement, but they do not buy the meteorite strike story either. Accusations of development and testing of weapons of mass destruction are flying and international tension is higher than ever."
 mem_visitor.54a:0 "Worrying"
 mem_visitor.54a.phile:0 "What have we done?"
 mem_visitor.54a.tooltip:0 "Our actions have caused tension among natives to grow. This has made them more §Ymilitarist§! and might lead to war between major nations in the future."
 
 mem_visitor.61.name:0 "Lost and Never Found"
 mem_visitor.61.desc:0 "It's been a while since the mysterious object impacted on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§!'s surface and we have not heard of it ever since. Our experts on the observation post firmly believe it was lost forever."
 mem_visitor.61a:0 "Much ado about nothing."
 
 mem_visitor.62.name:0 "Prophet from the Stars"
 mem_visitor.62.desc:0 "It seems the natives who recovered the object are now revering it as some kind of divine entity. We determined that the object is indeed capable of speaking and possesses a rudimentary AI, but its incoherent ramblings are impossible to decipher and are fairly useless. What its original purpose was and where it came from remains a mystery."
 mem_visitor.62a:0 "But its effect on society is very interesting."
 mem_visitor.62a.tooltip:0 "With their newfound religious leader, the natives become more §Yspiritualist§!."
 
 mem_visitor.63.name:0 "Alien Menace"
 mem_visitor.63.desc:0 "The object that recently crashed on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! Has resurfaced again in the form of a large exhibition by one of the planet's governments. At a gathering of top scientific experts and leaders of major nations, the object was unveiled as definitive proof of alien life. \n\nThe speeches during the exhibition stress the danger that the discovery points to, and what measures need to be taken to defend from it. "This changes everything," the lead scientist noted, "and we must be ready.""
 mem_visitor.63a:0 "Worrying."
 mem_visitor.63a.phobe:0 "It won't save them."
 mem_visitor.63a.tooltip:0 "The natives are readying themselves to fight alien incursions. This will make them more §Ymilitarist§!, §Yxenophobic§! or §Ymaterialist§!."
 
 mem_visitor.64.name:0 "Alien Teacher"
 mem_visitor.64.desc:0 "The object that recently crashed on §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! was revealed today to the general population by the planet's leading scientists. It appears to be some kind of interactive databank supplying them with advanced technology. \n\nThe scientists cite this as definitive proof of benevolent intelligence waiting in the depths of space, and they urge people to invest in scientific progress to meet the aliens among the stars."
 mem_visitor.64a:0 "Interesting."
 mem_visitor.64a.phobe:0 "How naive."
 mem_visitor.64a.phile:0 "We will be waiting."
 mem_visitor.64a.tooltip:0 "With alien knowledge spreading through their planet, the natives' advancement has been accelerated. With their newfound appreciation for alien knowledge, they will become more §Ymaterialist§! or §Yxenophilic§!."
 
 mem_visitor.71.name:0 "Blank Slug"
 mem_visitor.71.desc:0 "The object we recovered from the §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be less interesting than we hoped. It is definitely of advanced artificial origin, but unfortunately it is a solid slug of a supersolid compound. \n\nAfter eliminating all possibilities and not finding any cavities or other hidden compartments, we have to admit that we likely will never get much from it. The design of the slug and its material composition prove to be somewhat useful for our research, thankfully."
 mem_visitor.71a:0 "At least we got something out of it."
 
 mem_visitor.72.name:0 "Maniac Orb"
 mem_visitor.72.desc:0 "The object that crashed on the surface of §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be some sort of computer of alien origin encased in a spherical shell. We could not determine anything about its creators, but when we turned it on and established a connection to some of our computers, it produced a maniacal laughter and announced itself as our overlord, before realizing that it was plugged into a sealed wired network isolated from anything it can use to enslave us. \n\nIt is now promising us great rewards if we plug it into a bigger network, but our scientists are not inclined to trust it."
 mem_visitor.72a:0 "Maybe we can figure out some kind of deal?"
 mem_visitor.72b:0 "Destroy the dangerous machine."
 mem_visitor.72c:0 "Destroy the blasphemous machine!"
 mem_visitor.72d:0 "Disassemble the device and study it."
 mem_visitor.72a.tooltip:0 "Our scientists will negotiate with the orb."
 
 mem_visitor.73.name:0 "Petulant Orb"
 mem_visitor.73.desc:0 "The device recovered from §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be some sort of computer of alien origin encased in a spherical shell. The most notable aspect of it is its talkative nature. Currently, it is vocalizing by normal means and also broadcasting on multiple radio frequencies and flashing lights at us. \n\nThe message deciphered is always the same - a demand to be returned into space on a loop. Many scientists however can't help but laugh at the device's petulant whining."
 mem_visitor.73a:0 "Send it back into space."
 mem_visitor.73b:0 "Broadcast footage of it live across the empire."
 
 MEM_VISITOR_SEND_ORB_INTO_SPACE:0 "Return Orb Into Space"
 MEM_VISITOR_SEND_ORB_INTO_SPACE_DESC:0 "If the orb we have in our hands wants to go back to space so much, we are happy to oblige. Since it doesn't have its own propulsion, we would need to calculate its trajectory more carefully than we have needed to for a long time."
 
 mem_visitor.731.name:0 "Sending Orb into Space"
 mem_visitor.731.desc:0 "We have commissioned a small civilian freighter to travel to the outskirts of our home system and jettison the orb away at escape velocity. It can now be expected to spend at several thousand years travelling through interstellar space without an incident."
 mem_visitor.731a:0 "Its determination is inspiring"
 mem_visitor.731b:0 "Never come back!"
 
 mem_visitor.74.name:0 "Knowledge Bank"
 mem_visitor.74.desc:0 "The object we recovered from §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§! turned out to be a massive databank encased in a resilient shell. It doesn't contain any information about its origin; however, someone put quite a lot of data into it with the apparent goal to disseminate knowledge through the galaxy. \n\nSome of it is redundant to us, and some of it is just plain wrong, but our scientists are already finding gems of knowledge that could take our research in whole new directions."
 mem_visitor.74a:0 "We could use it."
 mem_visitor.74b:0 "We don't need xeno science."
 
 mem_visitor.81.name:0 "No Deal"
 mem_visitor.81.desc:0 "It seems that negotiations with the alien computer have come to a dead end. Frustrated, one of the scientists assigned to the project smuggled some construction hardware into the lab and took his frustration out on it with a plasma torch. It is unlikely that we will gain any useful intelligence from the currently puddle on the floor."
 mem_visitor.81a:0 "This was really unnecessary."
 
 mem_visitor.82.name:0 "Deal with the Orb"
 mem_visitor.82.desc:0 "Today we struck a bargain with the alien device. In exchange for its cooperation with us, we hooked it up to an endless stream of gossip publications on data networks from our empire and beyond. \n\nIts insights are already helping our military tacticians."
 mem_visitor.82a:0 "Good work."
 
 mem_visitor.83.name:0 "The Orb has Escaped!"
 mem_visitor.83.desc:0 "It seems the device we held in the lab has found a way to trick our technicians into shipping it to parts unknown. One of the data terminals contained a note to "filthy peasants" (presumably us) with the promise to not destroy us as we could be instrumental in its plans. \n\nWe have already found some influence in our systems leeching valuable data and processing power, but it is also providing some military information to our ships. Experts believe that it should not be able to cause lasting harm before it's located and removed, but it could take them time to do so."
 mem_visitor.83a:0 "We need to stop it"
 
 mem_visitor.84.name:0 "Maniac Orb Destroyed"
 mem_visitor.84.desc:0 "Today we finally traced the alien device that attached itself to our data networks. The security force sent to unplug it was faced with the threat of electrocution from the local power grid, encouraging them to use explosives to turn the orb into fine dust."
 mem_visitor.84a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 mem_visitor.91.name:0 "Mission Aborted"
 mem_visitor.91.desc:0 "Since we no longer have an observation outpost above §Y[mem_visitor_planet.GetName]§!, we can no longer continue tracking the object that recently crashed on the planet."
