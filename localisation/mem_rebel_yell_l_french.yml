 pc_mem_broken_city_desc: "This planet once had a massive city covering its entire surface, but some kind of cataclysmic event has torn the planet apart. \n\nRemains of massive arcologies are still discernible from orbit, warped and torn apart by massive forces."
 
 mem_rebel_yell.1.name: "Haunted System"
 mem_rebel_yell.1.desc: "The [From.GetName] system appears to contain remainders of a massive engagement. \n\nDespite the battle taking place a long time ago, the space is still littered by a large number of orbital debris. But there's something more to this system. \n\nThe [Root.GetName] reports that it has detected a faint signal being broadcast in the system, but despite all efforts we could not identify its source. Investigating the source of the signal would require more powerful and precise equipment, best placed on a stationary outpost."
 mem_rebel_yell.1.a: "How strange..."
 mem_rebel_yell.1.a.tooltip: "In order to locate the signal's source, we should construct an §Soutpost§! in the [From.GetName] system."
 mem_rebel_yell.1.b: "Make a note of the system."

 mem_rebel_yell.poi.1.desc: "We should construct and maintain an outpost here."
 mem_rebel_yell.2.name: "Signal in the [the_system.GetName] System"
 mem_rebel_yell.2.desc: "We have maintained our presence in the [the_system.GetName] system for quite a while now, and today we were finally able to trace the signal to the [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon] [the_planet.GetName]. \n\nThe concealed broadcast sends the same encrypted message on repeat, and by studying it close to the point of origin, we should be able to learn more."
 mem_rebel_yell.2.a: "We must get to the bottom of it."
 mem_rebel_yell.2.b: "Forget about it."
 mem_rebel_yell.3.name: "Rebel Yell"
 mem_rebel_yell.3.desc: "Our investigation of [the_planet.GetName] has returned results. The [Root.GetName] was able to fully record and decipher the signal originating from the [the_planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThe signal is a military broadcast addressed to "Resistance Ships" passing through the system. \n\nFrom what [Leader.GetName] can gather, [the_system.GetName] was the site of a massive defeat for said Resistance about two thousand years ago, and the forces they fought against all but obliterated them. \n\nThe broadcast instructed survivors to withdraw to a system. However, the coordinates of the system do not match the hyperlane network as it is known for us. Are they wrong, or is there another way to get there?"
 mem_rebel_yell.4.name: "Wormhole Discovered in the [the_system.GetName] System"
 mem_rebel_yell.4.desc: "Our insight into the encrypted signal broadcast across the [the_system.GetName] system has allowed us to see past some kind of jamming that had been concealing a wormhole on the outskirts of the system. Perhaps this is the way to reach the coordinates specified in the encrypted message?"
 mem_rebel_yell.4.a: "We should investigate this wormhole."
 mem_rebel_yell.4.a.tooltip: "A new §Swormhole§! has opened in the §Y[the_system.GetName] system§!."

 MEM_REBEL_YELL_RESOLVE_SIGNAL_DESC: "The strange signal is originating from §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! before being bounced around the system to conceal its origin. We should get close to the source, study it and hopefully decipher it."
 
 mem_rebel_yell_poi_chain_title: "Haunted System"
 mem_rebel_yell_poi_chain_desc: "A faint signal is haunting the [the_system.GetName] system. Having an outpost there should allow us to eventually find out more."

 mem_rebel_yell.5.desc:0 "On the other side of the wormhole, we have discovered a small fleet stationed in orbit of one of the planets. This seems to be where the Resistance retreated after their defeat. \n\nDespite their advanced age, the ships are in fairly good shape and heavily armed. Power signatures are still detectable within the ships - we should approach with caution."
 mem_rebel_yell.7.desc:0 "Stop! Who are you? Why are you firing on my ship? Stop firing on my ship! Identify yourselves!"
 mem_rebel_yell.7.a:0 "You fired on us first. Who are you?"
 mem_rebel_yell.8.desc:0 "Alright, you don't look like... them. So that's a relief. \n\nI am [princess.GetName], of the [princess_species.GetName] Kingdom. My father once led the galaxy in a desperate fight against creatures that called themselves the Vazurans. We failed. Our fleets were destroyed, and our worlds fell one by one. \n\nEventually, we were forced to retreat to a hidden system, here. We hoped more survivors would come, but in vain - no one came. Once our supplies started running out, we transferred control of our ships to an automatic custodian and put ourselves in cryogenic sleep. As time went on, sleep pods failed or had to be shut down to conserve power and preserve the most vital personnel. Eventually only the highest ranked survivor remained. That would be me. \n\nYour attack seems to have disabled our AI system, forcing my emergency reawakening. \n\nThe ship's systems are failing, and my time is running out. There's no place for me left in this galaxy. Whoever you are, I am willing to pledge my loyalty and my flagship to you in exchange for rescue."
 mem_rebel_yell.8.a:0 "We accept your offer."
 mem_rebel_yell.8.b:0 "We'll rescue you, but scrap the ship."
 mem_rebel_yell.8.c:0 "We could use your ship. But not you."
 mem_rebel_yell.8.d:0 "We don't need you or your ship."
 mem_rebel_yell.8.e:0 "Vazurans? We encountered them ourselves."
 mem_rebel_yell.8.e.response:0 "It pains me greatly to know those monsters still terrorize the galaxy, so many years after we fell to them. \n\nBut I should have expected that. Nothing seemed to be able to stop them."

 mem_rebel_yell.9.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] confirms the initial theory that the object within the icy crust of [From.GetName] is a ship. Presumably, it landed on the surface about two thousand years ago and was later covered in ice growth. To recover the ship would be tricky, but it's nothing our construction ships can't manage."

 mem_rebel_yell.10.name:0 "Lost Knight"
 mem_rebel_yell.10.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] reports that the efforts to recover a ship from [From.GetName] were a success. Judging by the on-board logs, the ship was a "Silver Knight"-class interceptor on patrol duty when it was forced to hide on the asteroid to evade a superior enemy. The pilot took refuge inside a stasis chamber and perished when the power ran out. \n\nDespite spending a long time inside an ice asteroid, the ship is in remarkably good shape and can be brought into service. It possesses some weaponry of highly unorthodox design."
 mem_rebel_yell.10.a:0 "Bring the ship into service."
