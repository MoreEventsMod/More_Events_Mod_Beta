 MEM_CONVICT_STUDY_POD: "Study the Pod"
 MEM_CONVICT_STUDY_POD_DESC: "The pod found on [the_planet.GetName] has been brought to our capital planet for study. In time, we should be able to understand the inscriptions and maybe even revive the alien inside."
 
 mem_convict_category: "Crash Landing"
 mem_convict_category_desc: "We can clearly see a long ravine on the surface, ending in what seems to be a ship half-buried in the ground. Someone crash-landed on this [This.GetPlanetMoon] a long time ago."
 
 mem_convict.1.name: "Crash Landing"
 mem_convict.1.desc: "The [Root.GetName] has been able to confirm that the ravine on the surface of [From.GetName] is, indeed, the result of a crash landing. The event is estimated to have occurred about a thousand years ago. \n\nThe flight crew seems to have perished in the crash, but [Leader.GetName] has discovered a still functional stasis pod inside the ship. The pod is covered in alien inscriptions we cannot yet decipher, but it can safely be detached and studied planetside."
 mem_convict.1.a: "Bring the pod to [Owner.Capital_Scope.GetName] for study."
 mem_convict.1.b: "It's not worth bothering."
 mem_convict.1.c: "Shut down the pod, killing the alien."
 mem_convict.2.name: "The Prison Pod"
 mem_convict.2.desc: "Our researchers have managed to translate the inscriptions on the stasis pod recovered from the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. \n\nIt warns that it contains a dangerous criminal named Retheri Rhin who is being transported into exile for various crimes. The exact charges are not specified, but from the context, Rhin appears to be a public servant of some sort implicated in a massive conspiracy."
 mem_convict.2.a: "Prepare to release the prisoner."
 mem_convict.2.b: "Better not open it."
 mem_convict.3.name: "Retheri Rhin"
 mem_convict.3.desc: "The prisoner of the alien pod is now awake. After a brief interrogation, he provided an account conflicting with inscription on his pod - he claims to have been unjustly imprisoned by the true conspirators within the Rendan Federation who sought to destroy everything the Rendan people held dear for personal gain. \n\nNow that his civilization is no longer around, he implores that there is no reason to honour his sentence. He offers his services as an administrator in exchange for pardon."
 mem_convict.3.a: "Deal."
 mem_convict.3.a.tooltip: "We gain a new §Serudite§! governor."
 mem_convict.3.a.auth: "In service to us, you will find redemption."
 mem_convict.3.a.ega: "Everyone deserves a second chance."
 mem_convict.3.a.mat: "A dead nation's verdict is meaningless."
 mem_convict.3.a.phile: "You can tell us so much of your lost culture."
 mem_convict.3.b: "We'd rather not risk it."
 mem_convict.3.b.tooltip: "Governor Rhin will be sent into exile."
 mem_convict.3.b.auth: "You can't be this easily absolved."
 mem_convict.3.b.ega: "We must honour law and order."
 mem_convict.4.name: "The Convict Governor"
 mem_convict.4.desc.corrupt: "We are receiving reports that governor [retheri_rhin.GetName], who we released from a prison pod, has been implicated in various crimes, including embezzlement, blackmail, assassination and terrorism. \n\nEven though there's no direct evidence, the amount of alleged suspicious activities on his part is staggering."
 mem_convict.4.desc.honest: "The governor [retheri_rhin.GetName], who we released from a prison pod, has proven himself to be a just and upstanding citizen and a competent public servant. If the charges that were made against him were true - something those who know him find hard to credit - he is seizing the opportunity at redemption that we granted him in both hands. "
 mem_convict.4.a: "We were wrong to trust him."
 mem_convict.4.b: "We were right to trust him."
 mem_convict.61.name: "Incursion"
 mem_convict.61.desc: "A unidentified ship has arrived in [FROM.Solar_System.GetName]. Long-range tracking suggests its path originated in the [origin_system.GetName] system. \n\nIt's hailing us."
 mem_convict.7.desc: "Attention! This is the fully-automatic supreme Rendan justice vessel Grim Portent speaking. \n\nYou are harboring a dangerous individual named Retheri Rhin, who is using your help to evade justice. Do not let him. \n\nTurn him over to me and justice will be served. The Rendan people might be dead, but their justice lives on in me."
 mem_convict.7.a: "Fine, you can have him."
 mem_convict.7.b: "No way."
 mem_convict.7.c: "What if we refuse?"
 mem_convict.7.c.responce: "It would be very... painful. I wouldn't recommend it."
 mem_convict.7.d: "Rhin is no longer with us."
 mem_convict.7.d.response: "My inbuilt lie detector suggests that this is true. Have a nice day then. \n\nAnd next time, please don't thaw everyone you find."
 mem_convict.7.e: "We don't know what are you talking about."
 mem_convict.7.e.response: "My inbuilt lie detector suggests that this is true. Have a nice day then."
 mem_convict.8.desc: "Well, hopefully you have learnt your lesson. The devastation of your planet [This.GetName] is well deserved. \n\nI have to leave now. I hope you will think about what you did."
 mem_convict.8.a: "Begone!"
 
 mem_convict.10.name: "Dead Ship"
 mem_convict.10.desc: "The [Root.GetName] has been able to confirm that the ravine on the surface of [From.GetName] is, indeed, a result of crash landing. The event is estimated to have occurred about a thousand years ago. One unusual feature of the ship is a stasis chamber in the cargo hold, but it has long since failed and only dust remains of its occupant.\n\n[Leader.GetName] was able to gain some insights into ship's unusual design which may be useful to our own research.
