 mem_viral_engine.10.name:0 "Viral Outbreak"
 mem_viral_engine.10.desc:0 "The authorities on [This.GetName] have reported the emergence of a new disease. While it isn't fatal, it does cause emotional distress and insomnia among the infected. It could be nothing - a minor cross-species virus gaining a foothold, perhaps. Regardless, we should take preventative measures to keep it from spreading while the biology department works to identify the pathogen."
 mem_viral_engine.10.a:0 "Quarantine the infected."
 mem_viral_engine.11.name:0 "Aberrant Behavior"
 mem_viral_engine.11.desc:0 "Thanks to our efforts, the virus has stopped spreading. But those already infected are experiencing more symptoms. Personality changes and sudden aggression to the medical staff have been reported. They have also lost interest in communicating with those outside the cordon, preferring to interact with other infected. Work continues to isolate whatever pathogen is responsible, but the team available on [This.GetName] is overwhelmed. They request assistance."
 mem_viral_engine.11.a:0 "See to it."
 mem_viral_engine.11.b:0 "We don't have time for this."
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_ISOLATE_PATHOGEN:0 "State of Emergency"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_ISOLATE_PATHOGEN_DESC:0 "[From.GetName]'s medical staff have called for assistance in identifying the disease affecting their world. A science vessel would greatly assist their efforts."
 mem_viral_engine.12.name:0 "The Infected"
 mem_viral_engine.12.desc:0 "The earlier reports of aggression and emotional disturbance among the infected on [From.GetName] have subsided. Instead, those in quarantine feel compulsions to start building something. They don't know what they wish to build, or if they do, they refuse to explain. People with no construction experience have begun to weld a metal framework, teachers are digging for a foundation, and indigents are writing code in an unknown octodecimal language. At this point it is impossible to tell what they are constructing."
 mem_viral_engine.12.generic:0 "Study the infected."
 mem_viral_engine.12.col:0 "Sequester the infected in a camp far from any city."
 mem_viral_engine.12.col.tooltip:0 "The infected population will be removed from the workforce."
 mem_viral_engine.12.phobe:0 "We must protect our people. Sequester the infected!"
 mem_viral_engine.12.phobe.tooltip:0 "The infected population will be removed from the workforce."
 mem_viral_engine.12.mat:0 "We must find a cure. Unleash our best minds."
 mem_viral_engine.12.ind:0 "Cure our people. Nothing must abridge free will."
 mem_viral_engine.12.spi:0 "This may be a voice from Beyond! Observe, but do not interfere."
 mem_viral_engine.12.spiphile:0 "There is a divine beauty in the alien mind. Do not interfere."
 mem_viral_engine.12.phile:0 "This may be an intelligence. We should let them finish."
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_STUDY_INFECTED:0 "Study of the Infected"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_STUDY_INFECTED_DESC:0 "The infected are behaving strangely. They are cooperating with each other to accomplish some as of yet unknown task. For the safety of our people, we should determine what their final goal is."
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_RESEARCH_CURE:0 "Find the Cure"
 MEM_VIRAL_ENGINE_RESEARCH_CURE_DESC:0 "Our people are being manipulated by some kind of alien virus. This cannot continue. We should begin a targeted campaign to find an antiviral medication capable of taking on this threat."
 mem_viral_engine.13.name:0 "Study Concluded"
 mem_viral_engine.13.desc:0 "Analysis of the infected behaviour has concluded in consensus. Those affected by the virus are constructing some kind of incredibly complex biological computer.\n\nOne of the infected approached our staff, claiming to speak for the rest. They claimed that the compulsions had taken the form of voices, and that these voices were telling them that they needed to submit their bodies to some kind of invasive procedure. They requested that we not interfere.\n\nWe have no idea what will happen to our people. This could be our last chance to stop this."
 mem_viral_engine.13.a:0 "Allow them to finish."
 mem_viral_engine.13.a.tooltip:0 "The infected activate their machine. We can only hope it is benign."
 mem_viral_engine.13.b:0 "Stop this at once!"
 mem_viral_engine.13.b.tooltip:0 "Construction will be stopped by whatever means necessary... including deadly force."
 mem_viral_engine.14.name:0 "Successful Isolation"
 mem_viral_engine.14.desc:0 "Our joint efforts with the administration of [This.GetName] have finally isolated the culprit. It is a virus, though one comprised of several amino acids not used in our own biology. It attacks the brain, performing subtle, almost targeted modifications to the areas responsible for decision making and emotional expression. Some of the virologists believe there is a greater intelligence guiding this process."
 mem_viral_engine.14.a:0 "We should consider our options"
 mem_viral_engine.15.name:0 "Out of Time"
 mem_viral_engine.15.desc:0 "Our researchers ran out of time. There are too many unknowns left, and the infected have nearly completed their machine."
 mem_viral_engine.15.a:0 "All we can do is wait... and hope."
 mem_viral_engine.16.name:0 "Isolation Complete"
 mem_viral_engine.16.desc:0 "For the greater good, we have completely removed the infected from our society. They shall be treated and cared for, but they will never be allowed to return. Our people rejoice at their sacrifice."
 mem_viral_engine.16.a:0 "They shall be honored!"
 mem_viral_engine.17.name:0 "Cure Found"
 mem_viral_engine.17.desc:0 "Success! An antiviral has been synthesized to expunge this strange infection. The rest of our populace on [This.GetName] is being inoculated as well to prevent this from happening again."
 mem_viral_engine.17.a:0 "Another victory for medical science."
 mem_viral_engine.22.name:0 "The Viral Engine"
 mem_viral_engine.22.desc:0 "Construction on [This.GetName] has completed, and our doctors report that there is no trace of the virus left in our people. The machine they built while under its influence is a computer based not on digital data, but on the movement of amino acids and protein groups. It's fascinating, if thoroughly alien.\n\nOur best guess is that the virus has built itself a habitat, a persistent simulated environment based on a compatible biological structure. Communication has been made possible through temporary surrogates, and in exchange for power and regular injections of organic material, the machine has offered us its use as a computational engine. Its utility in our research efforts could be immense."
 mem_viral_engine.22.a:0 "Glad this worked out for both sides."
 mem_viral_engine.22.a.tooltip:0 "The §YViral Engine§! is online, benefiting our research."
 mem_viral_engine.19.name:0 "Viral Insurgency"
 mem_viral_engine.19.desc:0 "We have successfully prevented any further activity by the infected. Unfortunately, this caused them to revert to terrifying violence. Local forces were forced to retaliate with lethal force. Some of the infected managed to escape and may prove to be a threat in the future. But the immediate problem has passed."
 mem_viral_engine.19.a:0 "Hunt them down!"
 mem_viral_engine.20.name:0 "The Viral Transmitter"
 mem_viral_engine.20.desc:1 "The infected have finished construction. The last visible portion was a radio transmitter dish. It activated shortly after completion, sending out a gargantuan amount of data into space. At some point, the virus was completely expunged from the bodies of the infected with an automated inoculation system. Those cured of the disease have returned to their original personalities, and claim almost no memory to what has transpired.\n\nThe current theory is that this device converted the virus' constituent components into coded electronic information, then transmitted this to some unknown location. We're left with more questions than answers, along with a very large, very useless radio transmitter."
 mem_viral_engine.20.a:0 "Good riddance."
 mem_viral_engine.21.name:0 "The Viral Bomb"
 mem_viral_engine.21.desc:0 "The infected's construction project was nothing but a ruse! The building concealed a massive viral dispersal system: A device whose sole purpose was to pour clouds of infectious agents into the atmosphere. An attempt at intervention was met with terrible violence by the infected, and new cases of the virus were reported across the planet. Security forces waged a desperate fight to stop the infected and quarantine those exposed. Cities convulsed with violence, and fires ravaged the world's industrial heartland. They managed to incarcerate or kill most of the insurgents, but some managed to escape into the wilderness. [This.GetName] mourns those lost in this brief but vicious civil war. It must rebuild, but it will never forget."
