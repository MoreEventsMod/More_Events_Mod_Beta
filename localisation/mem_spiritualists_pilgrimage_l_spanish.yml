 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.name:0 "A Denied Pilgrimage"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.desc:0 "A group of our pilgrims was denied access to their holy places on §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§! by your governor. He has denied them access for no known reason. This is outrageous, and you can be sure that if you don't allow them passage, this behaviour towards our noble people will not be forgotten!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.a:0 "We cannot risk our diplomatic relations. They shall pass!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.b:0 "They shall pass, but never be unwatched or unattended."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.2.c:0 "I'll let the governor explain his decision first."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.3.name:0 "A Pilgrim's Joy"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.3.desc:0 "The §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! pilgrims were welcomed with open arms by our colonists, and their presence brought out the best in everyone, leading to increased productivity throughout our colony. The §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! government sends us their regards and thanks you for your wise decision. It seems that our relations have improved to unimagined heights!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.3.a:0 "It is always nice to have guests!" 
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.4.name:0 "Successful Pilgrimage"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.4.desc:0 "The §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! pilgrims caused some wry looks at first, but soon blended into the usual colony life without making any problems. Their government seems grateful for us granting them passage, and our relations have been improved!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.4.a:0 "We could not have hoped for a better outcome." 
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.5.name:0 "Strange Guests"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.5.desc:0 "Though the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! pilgrims have been welcomed with open arms by our colonists, there was always a noticeable tension between them. As much as our people likes to have guests, sometimes it is a relief when they are gone..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.5.a:0 "A guest doesn't stay forever..." 
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.6.name:0 "Barbarians at the Gates"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.6.desc:0 "Those pilgrims might be seeking spiritual guidance by visiting holy places, but their religious practices offended many of our colonists, which even resulted in some open hostilities towards them. They were gone sooner than anyone could have hoped for, but our political relations with their government have worsened as a result."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.6.a:0 "Hopefully those barbarians won't return..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.7.name:0 "Ungrateful Guests"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.7.desc:0 "These pilgrims brought nothing but problems since the day they set foot on §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§!. One incident followed the other, and in the end the governor was forced to make them leave the planet. Relations with the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§! have been soured, and our colonists are angry that they were allowed to come to §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§! in the first place."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.7.a:0 "Now I understand the governor..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.8.name:0 "Terrorists!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.8.desc:0 "These so-called pilgrims are gone now - but not before blowing up our administrative complex. Though we have no evidence, we now believe they were covert operatives acting on behalf of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!. The [pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] do not even try to reject that accusation, which seems to be proof enough of their guilt."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.8.a:0 "A vile and cowardly act of aggression..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.9.name:0 "Terrorists!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.9.desc:0 "These so-called pilgrims are gone now - but not before blowing up our administrative complex. Though we have no evidence, we now believe they were covert operatives acting on behalf of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.9.a:0 "A vile and cowardly act of aggression..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.10.name:0 "Terrorists in Chains"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.10.desc:0 "Our security forces were able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrative district on §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§!. These so-called pilgrims have been caught red-handed and imprisoned, and now await their execution. The §Y[pilgrims_destination.owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! secret service deems them covert operatives of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!, although no §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! official would ever admit to this foul act."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.10.a:0 "Never trust an alien..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.11.name:0 "Terrorists on the Run"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.11.desc:0 "Our security forces were able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrative district on §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§!. These so-called pilgrims have been caught red-handed, but later managed to get away somehow. An insider must have helped them. The §Y[pilgrims_destination.owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! secret service deems them covert operatives of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!, although no §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! official would ever admit to this foul act."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.11.a:0 "Find those traitors in our ranks!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.12.name:0 "Terrorists and Traitors!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.12.desc:0 "Our security forces were unable to prevent a bomb attack on our administrative district on §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§!. Countless lives have been lost and the district lies in ruins. All evidence suggests that the culprits were these so-called pilgrims, who must in fact be covert agents of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!. They are, unsurprisingly, nowhere to be found now, but with all our agents monitoring them, they must have had help to pull this one off. Our secret service has started interrogating all involved personnel."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.12.a:0 "Heads will roll!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.name:0 "A Conspiracy Unfolding"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.desc:0 "The governor seems to be relieved that you took the time to speak with him first before making a rash decision. He informs you about hints of an imminent terrorist attack planned by covert operatives of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!. He says they have tried to find supporters for their plan, but fortunately for us contacted the wrong person. They tried to bring a loyal officer of the security personnel into their plan, and the officer was able to play a charade until he was able to contact the governor. Unfortunately, they were unable to find out how many of our men are involved into this conspiracy, which is why he stayed quiet about his reasons until now."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.a:0 "Change the security staff and set a trap."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.b:0 "Don't take a risk. Just deny them access."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.13.c:0 "He is just paranoid. Let them pass."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.14.name:0 "They Took the Bait"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.14.desc:0 "Thanks to our governor, our loyal security forces were able to prevent a bomb attack on our administrative district on §Y[pilgrims_destination.GetName]§!. These so-called pilgrims have been caught red-handed and imprisoned, and now await their execution. Unsurprisingly, §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! officials deny any involvement."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.14.a:0 "Someone give that man a medal!"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.15.name:0 "Just Paranoia"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.15.desc:0 "Someone must have warned them as no attack has been attempted. Those "pilgrims" just visited their holy places and left without making any problems. Or maybe that governor is just too paranoid for his own good."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.15.a:0 "It could have been worse..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.16.name:0 "The Liar"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.16.desc:0 "What seemed to be a perfect plan was taken apart by an overly zealous security man, who gunned down one of the pilgrims he thought was reaching for a weapon. What is even worse is that they turned out to be real pilgrims. The security officer who had informed the governor before was just a meddler and his story a lie."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.16.a:0 "How could we have known?"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.17.name:0 "Safety at a Price"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.17.desc:0 "The §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! officials didn't like your decision. But on the bright side of things, our colony is safe... at least for the time being."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.17.a:0 "Nothing else matters."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.18.name:0 "Paranoid Governor"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.18.desc:0 "The fears of our governor have proven to be unfounded. The §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! pilgrims were welcomed with open arms by our colonists, and their presence brought out the best in everyone, leading to increased productivity throughout our colony. The §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetSpeciesAdj]§! government sends us their regards and thanks you for your wise decision. It seems that our relations have improved to unimagined heights!"

 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.22.a:0 "It could have been much worse... I think..."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.23.name:0 "The Governor's Warning"
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.23.desc:0 "We should have paid more attention to our governor's concerns. Our security personnel were caught totally off guard when the first bombs went off. Countless lives have been lost and the administrative district lies in ruins. All clues point to these so-called pilgrims, who must in fact be covert agents of the §Y[pilgrims_origin.GetName]§!.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these "pilgrims" are now nowhere to be found. It seems someone helped them to escape, supporting the governor's story of an infiltration of our security staff."
 mem_spiritualists_pilgrimage.23.a:0 "I should have trusted his judgement!"
