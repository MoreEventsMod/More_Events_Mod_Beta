# First Event
mem_under_blanket.1.name: "Under the Blanket"
 mem_under_blanket.1.desc: "Early reports speak of mysterious activity deep below the surface of [Root.GetName]. Analysis of the scanned signatures points to the probable existence of a formerly unknown species. Our scientists are more than eager to attempt a ground operation to study them."
 mem_under_blanket.1.materialist: "We should study them right away. This is an exciting discovery."
 mem_under_blanket.1.xenomilit: "These xenos could be dangerous. Take all the necessary precautions."
 mem_under_blanket.1.others: "Send them in but take all the necessary safety precautions."
 mem_under_blanket.1.deny: "They have more important work to do."
 
 # Event Selection
mem_under_blanket.2.name: "Leadership Crisis"
 mem_under_blanket.2.desc: "After a brief scientific consortium, all resources and funds have been assigned and the expedition is almost ready to begin. However, they could not yet decide who should lead the expedition. They ask for your opinion.\n\nIt is worth noting that during the complete duration of the expedition, the selected scientist won't be able to perform any other tasks.\n\nThe candidates for expedition leadership are:"

 # Ground Team
mem_under_blanket.3.name: "Ground Team"
 mem_under_blanket.3.desc: "Our expedition has passed the first layers of sedimentary rock and is reporting back. Multiple signs of artificial erosion around the walls indicates the presence of lifeforms. An estimation approximates that thousands of this species' individuals are nearby or have passed through this very location. The team's proximity sensors warn the team of approaching heat signatures. Forced to stop, they heard rustlings in the rock approaching ever nearer to them. Should these aliens be aggressive, our small expedition could potentially be overrun within moments.\n\nContact is imminent."
 mem_under_blanket.3.retreat.xenomilit: "To all units, retreat immediately."
 mem_under_blanket.3.retreat.others: "It's too dangerous to proceed. Retreat."
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.materialist: "What are their intentions? Did we disturb them?"
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.xenomilit: "Get the soldiers ready. Protect the scientists."
 mem_under_blanket.3.contact.others: "Exercise caution but proceed with the investigation."
 
 # Retreat - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.10.name: "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.10.desc: "After receiving the order, the squad quickly tried to escape. Loud, guttural groans of the unknown xeno vibrated around the cave's walls. Out of the shadows, dozens of beasts charged our team, and three of our soldiers were instantly ripped to shreds. Striking from gaps in the walls, multiple large claws violently eviscerated six other members. Only [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] and one soldier managed to make it to the exit. Feeling that it was his sense of duty to protect [Root.GetName], the remaining soldier sacrificed himself with an emergency nuclear warhead, allowing [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] to escape and leave the horror behind."
 mem_under_blanket.10.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.10.others: "We will remember them."

 # Retreat - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.11.name: "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.11.desc: "While exiting, the group barely realized that an almost undetectable moving form was following in the shadows. Our soldiers shot the invisible form with powerful energy emitter bolts, incapacitating the unknown menace. After taking the xeno to a shielded cell on the ship, the most capable scientists concluded that the specimen was a juvenile with multiple DNA mutations.\n\nThe exit to the tunnels has since been sealed."
 mem_under_blanket.11.xenomilit: "The dissection of this xeno will educate us."
 mem_under_blanket.11.others: "Observation of this xeno will reveal its species' secrets."

 # Retreat - Third Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.12.name: "Retreat"
 mem_under_blanket.12.desc: "Exercising caution, the expedition crew moved their way towards the exit of the tunnel.\nThe monitors were eerily silent. The team managed to secure the cave's entrance, leaving the alien life form a mystery. Our scientists had time to launch an orb scan, giving us precious architectural information.\n\n[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] plans to keep monitoring the situation remotely."
 mem_under_blanket.12.xenomilit: "Bomb the site."
 mem_under_blanket.12.others: "This new species hasn't revealed all its secrets yet."
 
 # First Contact - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.20.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.20.desc: "[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] orders the escort to hold back. With hesitation, a small unknown figure approaches our group. The scientist extends his hand to initiate friendly contact. The creature carefully smells the hand before rubbing its head into it. After a brief moment, a guttural moaning noise comes out of the creature. Suddenly, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] gets rapidly swarmed by hundreds of these small furry specimens. These strange, innocent animals seem to enjoy cuddling a lot."
 mem_under_blanket.20.xenomilit: "They can be used as slave labour."
 mem_under_blanket.20.others: "Our people will likely adopt them."

 # First Contact - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.21.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.21.desc: "The scientific mission pursues its investigations into a large chamber. Our temperature and humidity measuring instruments reveal a tropical ecosystem containing vegetation and water, perfectly designed for wildlife. Tens of thousands of small organic creatures seem to peacefully live here. Early observations suggest that the awake creatures are watchmen guarding the hibernating ones.\n\n[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] and the scientific consortium will continue the research remotely to prevent any contamination and avoid disturbing the creatures."
 mem_under_blanket.21.xenophobe: "Bomb the site, we can't take risks."
 mem_under_blanket.21.others: "A fascinating self-sufficient species."
 
 # First Contact - Third Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.22.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.22.desc: "The wildlife we have discovered is far more violent and dangerous than we first expected. While trying to communicate that we came in peace, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] was lacerated by the claws of the beasts. We had to abort the mission and secure the zone. Thanks to our heavy autocannon sentries armed with nuclear-grade ammunition, we easily contained the rush of beasts. While the backup team secured the exit, thousands of bullets and growls could be heard behind the reinforcements that were urgently being deployed."
 mem_under_blanket.22.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.22.others: "A regrettable loss."

 # First Contact - Fourth Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.23.name: "First Contact"
 mem_under_blanket.23.desc: "Even after taking precautions when approaching the wildlife, [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] still ended up surrounded. The alpha creature gave a single brutal guttural groan as it shredded the scientist into tatters. The escort rapidly fired back but were trampled by thousands of the creatures. The last communications from the backup team reported a big earthquake before the signal suddenly went dead. We have been overrun by this dangerous wildlife.\n\nWe must abandon the mission and secure the region immediately."
 mem_under_blanket.23.desc.delayed: "What was seen by automatic systems as regular earthquakes in an area of [Root.GetName] has alerted military radars.\n\nMultiple unknown signatures converged in an area where we had established several large cities. Shortly after a couple of cycles of invasions by these unknown signatures, we lost contact with the region. A third of the area was reportedly destroyed and completely overrun with no survivors. Critical orbital strikes were ordered to contain the propagation.\n\nAnalysis of raw data shows that the invasion originated from an unexplored and unsecured underground cavity. The scientific community has strongly criticised our failure to study while we had the chance."
 mem_under_blanket.23.desc.captured: "The captured adolescent creature has started to reveal its secrets. As innocent as it looks for its size, about half the size of a [root.owner.GetName], its three large, sharp claws fixed on its neck shouldn't be ignored. Composed of eight support members, the alien was capable of moving all around its cell with remarkable agility. The bulky chest hides twelve small hearts, protected by a body armour shaped of harder rotten flesh that showed great resistance. Dietarily, it has an exclusive preference for living things, especially their brains. Specialists can't uncover any kindness or intelligence, it seems many driven by its survival instincts.\n\nHowever, the mutant keeps sending undetectable low frequency signals to the cave.\n\nToday, alarming seismic data all around [Root.GetName] is being reported. The dangerousness of the early signals has triggered a planetary security protocol, with military forces deployed to all regions. Swarms a fourth the size of the alien previously studied rushed us from the ground. Well prepared and entrenched, most of the assault is contained thanks to our knowledge of their weak points and the courage of our forces. Unfortunately, with the fighting hardest at the area around the cave, many lives were lost in this region."
 mem_under_blanket.23.tooltip: "A pop is killed and §RDangerous Wildlife§! now roams over [Root.GetName]."
 mem_under_blanket.23.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 mem_under_blanket.23.others: "This is a tragedy."
 
 # Under the Blanket - Follow up to Retreat #3
 mem_under_blanket.120.name: "Under the Blanket"
 mem_under_blanket.120.desc: "Our probe finished its route in the underground gallery before being destroyed by the inhabitants. Further analysis of the collected data gives more awareness about the unknown organism. Signatures show it tends to continue to expand and growth, which can be seen as dangerous even if it doesn't cause any destabilisation or harm on [Root.GetName].\n\nThe science department, headed by [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName], concludes that the organic species seems to feed by swallowing crystallites that provide life nutrients and give off gases. Our leadership on [Root.GetName] urges the importance of mining these strategic crystals and decimating the uncontrollable menace." 
 mem_under_blanket.120.noxenophile: "Strategic resources should be prioritised."
 mem_under_blanket.120.all: "Do not harm them. Send an escort."
 
 # Genocide
 mem_under_blanket.121.name: "Genocide"
 mem_under_blanket.121.desc: "We were capable of determining that the gas produced by the organism is highly combustible. The military decided to torch the entire gallery - the crystals being immune, there would be no consequences. From a fortified position around the entrance, the launch sequence of the missile was initiated. An eerie silence made the outpost nervous. As thunderous bursts deep in the cave were heard, a massive fireball engulfed the entrance, the ground crackling under the heat.\n\nIn no time, the sterilizing team made a move inside, equipped with fireproof suits and heavy equipment. The tunnels were sketched by freshly claws marks. They arrived in the biggest chamber, the last known location of the probe - the nest. Suffocation and squeaks of agony surrounded the place. Thousands of creatures cowered in suffering, and the squad quickly realized that the floor was a veil of thousand calcined carcasses. At the edge of the cavity, a horrifically burned creature struggled, trying to reach a shelter before slipping away. Here is the end of a whole life form. Haunted shrieks can still be perceived.n\n\The crystallites remain intact." 
 mem_under_blanket.121.a: "Clean the chamber and start excavation."
 mem_under_blanket.121.b: "At what cost."
 
 # Heritage - First Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.122.name: "Heritage"
 mem_under_blanket.122.desc: "Determined to make contact with the life form, the team carefully rendezvous to the last localization of our orb scanner. As attested beforehand, gas is detected. It is unexpectedly pungent. Thundery deep bursts start to become audible as the escort makes its way closer. The beasts are now visually identified, but they don't look disgruntled by our presence. Hulking with a rock armor and chunky, their gluttonous behavior shows a geophagia diet. As we observe them, our scientists discover that the creatures stop eating the crystals at regular intervals and stand still before kneeling. From a different angle, a large dilatation of the skin is perceptible on the lower body, followed by gas. Something dense came out. [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is sure of it: They produce enriched minerals."
 mem_under_blanket.122.a: "Fascinating."

 # Heritage - Second Outcome
 mem_under_blanket.123.name: "Heritage"
 mem_under_blanket.123.desc: "[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is reported missing. After investigation, a secret stash of casebooks and a custom-built analysis machine are exposed in [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHisHer] laboratory. Spectrograph sketches, multiple erasures and various annotations all over the pages acknowledge an incredible find by the inexperienced scientist: The gas seems to communicate. Highly volatile and mutagenic, the fume form was able to shape itself into different chemical signatures.\n\nH-I, Co-N-V-Er-Ge, U-S, He-Re, F-O-U-Nd, La-W-S, As, O-Ne.\n\nFollowing a sequence revealing a coordinate based on atomic weight values, a rescue team is on its way.n\n[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is found unconscious, levitating naked and holding a spherical obsidian stone on [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] chest in the middle of a large crystallite chamber. As the group approach closer, a dense multicolor veil of vapor emerges from [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHisHer] body, suddenly waking [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHimHer]. In shock, he proclaims as [mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetSheHe] fall[mem_under_blanket_selected_leader.GetSXX]  to the ground: "I know everything, laws converge as one. ""
 mem_under_blanket.123.a: "Fascinating."
