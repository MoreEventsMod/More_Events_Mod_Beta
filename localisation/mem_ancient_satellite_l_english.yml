 mem_ancient_satellite_category_desc:0 "Scans of §Y[Root.GetName]§! show a large object of unknown origin just above the scorchingly hot chromosphere of the star. This object is slowly orbiting around the star at a stable orbit, but how it got there and how it remains intact is as of yet unknown."
 mem_ancient_satellite.1.name:0 "Ancient Satellite"
 mem_ancient_satellite.1.desc:0 "Further study shows that the device close to the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is some sort of entirely automated ancient research station. By all accounts, the device should not be able to remain secure, but an advanced design has protected it from the harsh environment. The satellite, however, is responding to §Y[Root.GetName]§!'s hails, returning information on the dangerous environment of the star - and obeying simple orders given to it, including orders to change its location.\n\nTwo proposals have been made. We could keep the station where it is now and use the unique location to our advantage, or we could order the station to travel to a higher orbit so that we can safely study the satellite's composition. Either choice would provide information possibly hundreds of years beyond what we could currently know, but only one can be made. How should we proceed?"
 mem_ancient_satellite.1.a:0 "Leave it there and study the star."
 mem_ancient_satellite.1.b:0 "Bring it up. Let's see what this thing is made of."
 mem_ancient_satellite.100.name:0 "Coronal Mass Ejection"
 mem_ancient_satellite.100.desc:0 "While getting closer to §Y[From.From.GetName]§!'s surface in order to further analyze the mysterious object, a sudden solar flare forced the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to retreat. After a series of well-executed maneuvers from the ship's pilots, they managed to safely make it out of the way. However, further attempts to detect the object have failed. How it had survived previous coronal ejections is unknown, but the fact remains that it appears to have been destroyed."
 mem_ancient_satellite.100.a:0 "Such excitement for no payoff."
 mem_ancient_satellite.150.name:0 "Coronal Mass Ejection"
 mem_ancient_satellite.150.desc:0 "While getting closer to §Y[From.From.GetName]§!'s surface in order to further analyze the mysterious object, a sudden solar flare forced the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to retreat. Despite their best efforts, the crew of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! could not escape the rapid expansion of solar material. The §Y[This.GetName]§! was destroyed, and all hands perished with it. Further attempts to detect the object have failed. How it survived previous coronal ejections is unknown, but the fact remains that it appears to have been destroyed."
