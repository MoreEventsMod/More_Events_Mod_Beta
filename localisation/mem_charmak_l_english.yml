 mem_charmak.1.name: "The Charmak"
 mem_charmal.1.desc: "The interior of the ship is littered with mummified dead bodies. Some bodies bear signs of violent death, but most seem to have perished from starvation and life support failure. All of them belong to a species of small, but resillient and physically adept avian species who called themselves the §SCharmak§! which was active in this region of the galaxy about 800 years ago. \n\nTheir physiology shows signs of spaceborn adaptation, suggesting that they have abandoned planetside habitation at some point in their past to live aboard spacecrafts such as this one."
 mem_charmak.2.name: "The Charmak Horde"
 mem_charmak.2.desc: "Further study of the ship found on [From.Planet.GetName] and various artefacts aboard granted us more insights into the §SCharmak§! society. \n\nThe Charmak organized their clan-based society primarily based on physical strength and martial prowess. The strong would violently coerce the weaker brethern to follow their orders, while fighting one another for the dominance. The strongest of them would be called a §YCharmakar§! and serve as a leader of a clan. \n\nThe life of Charmak was short and brutal, but for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with them it was much worse. The Charmak were a society of planet looters, attacking planetside settlements with reckless discregard for personal safety, killing and pillaging everything they can come across. \n\nVery few of their activities didn't revolve around this neverending looting - most of those not involved in combat would work manufacturing and designing new weapons; the select few who lived to become too wounded or infirm to fight or work would find employment creating art to inspire their comrades to pillage harder or cataloguing trophies gained in the recent raids."
 mem_charmak.3.name: "The Charmakarade"
 mem_charmak.3.desc: "The purpose of the ship found in orbit above [From.Planet.GetName] became clearer. The vessel was a flagship of one of the most prominent and prosperous clans in the Charmak horde and a site of regular meetings of Charmakars from all over the horde known as §SThe Charmakarade§!. \n\nThe clans were mostly insular, but occassional meetings were called to establish alliances, coordinate attacks or address other concerns of the entire horde. On average, each charmakarade left 53% of the charmakars in agreement and other 47% dead."
 mem_charmak.4.name: "The Orange Freaks"
 mem_charmak.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports finding records from the last Charmakarade ever held on a ship [Leader.GetSheHe] is studying. It has taken place not long before the collapse of Charmak civilisation. \n\nThe meeting was concerning a new foe the horde has encountered - Charmaks did not care to learn their identity, reffering to them simply as §SOrange Freaks§!. They have conducted a series of hit-and-run attacks on smaller, more isolated clans in the horde which was something unheard of for the Charmak - and finding themselves on the receiving end of the attacks for once was a cause of great concern. \n\nMany Charmakars have pledged their clans' support to the retaliation campaign."
 mem_charmak.5.name: "The Fall of the Horde"
 mem_charmak.5.desc: "The records of the last years of the Charmak society are scarce, but §Y[Leader.GetName]§! now believes that [Leader.GetSheHe] can reconstruct their downfall. \n\nThe campaign to fight the §SOrange Freaks§! was successful and their society was wiped out as a result. Large number of Charmak who were captured in the initial raids were found, liberated and publically shamed for their weakness, however something strange has happened afterwards. \n\nIt appears their captors were trying to turn prisoners to their side and in doing so discussed in great details their social and political difference. This information was then passed on others. \n\nNever before the Charmak bothered to study the structure of societies they terrorize and while revelation that it's possible to select one's leaders based on something other than their capacity for violence did not impress them at first, it has profound effect on their psyche in the long run. The more their thuough about this, the more it caused them to doubt the Charmak ways, eventually driving them to compulsive insubordination or deep melancholy, where they would simply refuse to follow orders, even when threatened with death, and ultimately refused to eat, drink and maintain their ships. \n\nWithin a decade their entire society has collapsed and once fearsome species became extinct. Their flagship, the §YCharmakaradum§! remains however, and we can restore it back to working condition."
