# Start of Ancient Robots Sequence:

 mem_ancient_robots.201.name:0 "Not the First"
 mem_ancient_robots.201.desc:0 "While prospecting a promising area our colonial mining corporation made a remarkable discovery on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. They found fragments of an ancient humanoid robot that seems to be millions of years old. This find disproves our assumption that we were the first intelligent lifeform to inhabit this planet. More thorough scans of the planet will be needed to shed more light on this precursor civilization."
 mem_ancient_robots.201.a:0 "Make it so!"
 
# Initial Scanning Special Project:
 
 MEM_ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT:0 "Further Planetary Scans"
 MEM_ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientific community urges us to perform more thorough scans of §Y[This.GetName]§! in order to determine promising locations for archeological excavations. They emphasize that we could uncover more about the ancient precursor civilisation that once inhabited the planet."

# Further Scans Performed:
 
 mem_ancient_robots.203.name:0 "Not a Mountain"
 mem_ancient_robots.203.desc:0 "Our scientists were already pleading to finally stop these fruitless scans on §Y[Root.GetName]§! when a mountain - or, at least, what we formerly believed to be a mountain - turned out to be something else. What it might be specifically is still unknown but one thing is certain: It is made of metal - a tremendous amount of it. §Y[From.GetLeaderName]§! has proposed an excavation to find out what lies under the rock.\n\nThe estimated cost for this endeavor is 200£energy and 200£minerals ."
 mem_ancient_robots.203.a:0 "Do it!"
 mem_ancient_robots.203.b:0 "Ask me again later."
 mem_ancient_robots.203.c:0 "No, and don't ask me again."
 
# Reminder:

 mem_ancient_robots.204.name:0 "Excavation Plans"
 mem_ancient_robots.204.desc:0 "The scientific community on §Y[Root.GetName]§! wants to remind you that their planet still has a major unsolved mystery. Plans for an excavation of a bizarre metal mountain have been postponed until now. Our scientists once again request that we back this undertaking.\n\nThe estimated cost for this endeavor is 200£energy and 200£minerals ."
 mem_ancient_robots.204.a:0 "Do it!"
 mem_ancient_robots.204.b:0 "Ask me again later."
 mem_ancient_robots.204.c:0 "No, and don't ask me again."
 
# Excavation Project:

 MEM_ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_2:0 "Excavating the Mystery"
 MEM_ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_2_DESC:0 "After raising the needed funds, our construction crews can finally begin the real work in investigating the mysterious metallic mountain. To abrade away an entire mountain is neither a small feat nor done in one day."
 
# Excavation Completed:

 mem_ancient_robots.206.name:0 "An Ancient Factory"
 mem_ancient_robots.206.desc:0 "Thanks to our previous scans, our teams at the excavation site were unsurprised when they found an alien mega structure beneath the thick layer of rock. What did surprise them is that, despite its age of millions of years, it is still largely intact. Our team has already managed to access what seems to be a robot assembly plant with a connected factory for manufacturing individual components. Some of these robots have been sent to research labs for closer examination. Meanwhile, the science teams will try to establish a forward base inside the structure and hope to be able to power at least parts of the ancient machinery."
 mem_ancient_robots.206.a:0 "Astounding! Go on."

# Someone Else Did the Excavation:

 mem_ancient_robots.207.name:0 "An Ancient Factory"
 mem_ancient_robots.207.desc:0 "It seems some private investors funded an excavation on §Y[Root.GetName]§! to find out what mystery lies beneath that anomalous mountain range we found a few years ago. At first they deemed their undertaking to be very profitable but when they realized the significance of their finding, and possible legal actions towards them should they not inform us, they contacted the local governor. Under tons of rock lies an impressive structure formerly used to mass produce some kind of robots. Some units have already been sent to research labs for closer examination while our science teams at the site prepare to reach further into that complex."
 mem_ancient_robots.207.a:0 "A smart decision. Go on."
 
# Analyzing Robot Parts: 

 MEM_ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_3:0 "Ancient Robot Analysis"
 MEM_ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_3_DESC:0 "Our scientists are eager to start studying the ancient robot units found in a precursor factory."
 
# Happy Outcome of the Discovery:

 mem_ancient_robots.208.name:0 "A Ghost in the Shell"
 mem_ancient_robots.208.desc:0 "When our scientists managed to connect the factory complex to our colony's energy grid they unwittingly initiated a chain reaction, activating the whole complex instead of only some parts of it. This led to a short blackout in our colony before they were able to compensate for the unexpected energy drain. After the initial flurry they noticed small drones flying around and starting to repair structural damage, But the most fascinating find was an AI operating the facility - and despite the fact that this place seems to be of military origin, it is quite docile and accepts us as its new masters."
 mem_ancient_robots.208.a:0 "As it should be."
 
# Robots Attack! - Immediately on Excavation:

 mem_ancient_robots.209.name:0 "King of my Castle"
 mem_ancient_robots.209.desc:0 "When our scientists managed to connect the factory complex to our colony's energy grid they unwittingly initiated a chain reaction, activating the whole complex instead of only some parts of it. This led to a blackout in our colony. After powering up again we received a short, interrupted message from our science team saying that an AI program has taken control of the facility. Since then we have received nothing but silence. Intel from orbital satellites shows an army of robots pouring out of the facility. The colonial defense force is on high alert."
 mem_ancient_robots.209.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"
 
# Robots Attack! - After Working For a While

 mem_ancient_robots.210.name:0 "King of my Castle"
 mem_ancient_robots.210.desc:0 "The AI managing the ancient factory on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has gone rogue. Armies of robots are pouring out of the complex. Our colonial defense force has been completely caught by surprise and is barely managing to hold its position. They demand immediate reinforcements or the colony might fall."
 mem_ancient_robots.210.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"

# Under Siege Modifier:

 mem_under_siege:0 "Ongoing Conflict"
 mem_under_siege_desc:0 "Ongoing conflict is damaging the planet's economy."

# Victory Over Initial Robot Attack:

 mem_ancient_robots.211.name:0 "Gaining the Offense"
 mem_ancient_robots.211.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive the robots back to their source. But an attack on the citadel, as the factory is called by our generals, would be futile without preparation and enough force. They have devised plans for a military campaign to retake the citadel. As soon as our ground forces are ready we can start the siege."
 mem_ancient_robots.211.a:0 "Start the preparations."
 
# Defeat in Initial Robot Attack:

 mem_ancient_robots.212.name:0 "Colony Overrun"
 mem_ancient_robots.212.desc:0 "Our colonial defense forces have been overrun by the machines. Our colonists are on the run and hiding in the outskirts of the colony, but the robots have already begun hunting them down. We must push them back!"
 mem_ancient_robots.212.a:0 "Send our forces!"
 
# Siege Project:

 MEM_SIEGE_PROJECT:0 "Besieging the Citadel"
 MEM_SIEGE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our forces are in place. Artillery fire is forcing the robots onto the defensive while our forces prepare to make the final push into the breach."

 mem_ancient_robots.213.name:0 "Doomsday"
 mem_ancient_robots.213.desc:0 "The final assault has begun. Our forces have begun an all out attack on the citadel."
 mem_ancient_robots.213.a:0 "To victory!"

# Victory Over Evil Robots:

 mem_ancient_robots.214.name:0 "Victory!"
 mem_ancient_robots.214.desc:0 "The attack was successful. Our forces reached the citadel's center and disabled the AI's processing core. Once no longer controlled by the AI all remaining robots deactivated themselves. After the fighting was over our soldiers discovered an ancient data cache containing a variety of useful data ranging from historical documentations to scientific insights near the shut down AI Core.\n\nWith this factory under our control once more we may use the remaining rare resources to build a limited number of robots for our own armies. Perhaps these can give us an edge over our foes."
 mem_ancient_robots.214.a:0 "Compliment our troops on their victory."

# Defeat in Second Robot Attack:

 mem_ancient_robots.215.name:0 "Day of Reckoning"
 mem_ancient_robots.215.desc:0 "Our forces walked right into a trap. The battle was over before our generals even knew a trap had been sprung. Robots poured out of the ground surrounding the attacking army, catching them totally unprepared. Shortly thereafter we lost all contact with ground personnel. Orbital satellites reveal what has happened after our defeat. §Y[FROM.FROM.GetName]§! is uninhabitable now. A giant graveyard and monument to our failed attempt to acquire technology that is far above our understanding."
 mem_ancient_robots.215.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
# Robot Analysis Completed:

 mem_ancient_robots.220.name:0 "Ancient Robots"
 mem_ancient_robots.220.desc:0 "These recovered robot units, despite being millions of years old, seem to be of a very advanced design that our scientists cannot even begin to recreate with our current level of technology. They seem to be made for a single purpose, that every single part of them screams out: war. We cannot copy them, but our own research on advanced robotics will greatly benefit from this find."
 mem_ancient_robots.220.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 #A small group of citizens have barricaded themselves.
 mem_ancient_robots.225.name:0 "Isolated"
 mem_ancient_robots.225.desc:0 "The siege has claimed many lives. Only a small group of citizens were able to barricade themselves in an area where they are safe for the time being."
