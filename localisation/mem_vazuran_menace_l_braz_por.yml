Several personnel experienced what they described as psychotic episodes during these moments. Affected by this phenomenon as well, the chief scientist decided to return to the shuttle, fearing that remaining longer would put the team in danger.

Though physically unharmed, the events have had a lasting effect on [root.Leader.GetHimHer].\n\nFurther scans showed traces of a superdense compound spread across the planet's surface, which is likely to originate from the weapons used in its destruction, supporting [root.Leader.GetName]'s claims."

We thought we could stop the 'Destroyers'. We were not a young race like the others they have brought down - we have travelled the galaxy for a millennium. But they have bested us. By the time this message is found, nothing else will remain of our once proud race.

Unlike our shields, which absorb the energy of incoming attacks until they are depleted, the field this generator creates permanently suppresses energy transmissions so that only a fraction of them reach the protected object.\n\nWhile it works against any kind of weapon, tests have shown it to be most effective against energy-based ones. Though the application of this technology to our own fleet might seem tempting at first, our experiments demonstrated problematic side-effects caused by this protective device. The suppression of energy transmission is not limited on energy coming from outside its zone of effect but affects internal ship systems as well. So far, no way of shielding them from the damper field's effects has been found.\n\nOur [root.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] have only managed to gain a rudimentary understanding of the technology's underlying scientific principles. However, this is nonetheless a significant step in overcoming the Vazuran technological superiority and should improve our chances in battles against their ships."
