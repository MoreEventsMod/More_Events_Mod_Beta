 mem_mountain_gas_giant_dig_site: "The Ring Station"
 mem_mountain_gas_giant_dig_site_desc: "An ancient ring encircles §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! - a space station of a long-forgotten civilization. \n\nThe technology of the station matches the majority of the debris in the system, though it has been spared most of the damage. The source of the forcefield surrounding the nearby moon must also be inside."
 mem_mountain_moon_dig_site: "The Mountain"
 mem_mountain_moon_dig_site_desc: "The only noteworthy feature on this barren world is a giant mountain close to one of its poles. \n\nAncient landing pads, tunnel entrances and other structures are built into the rock, ready to receive visitors from distant worlds."

 mem_mountain.1.name: "The Ring Station"
 mem_mountain.1.desc: "The circular station orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§! appears to be relatively intact and is the likely source of the forcefield surrounding nearby planet. \n\nA proper archaeological expedition is necessary to find out more about it."

 mem_mountain.10.name: "The Waystation"
 mem_mountain.10.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! is ready to report [Leader.GetHerHis] first findings regarding the station's purpose. Referred to as §S\"The Waystation\"§!, it was operated by a private military contractor with a dual purpose: as a military hub protecting the entire system and as a transport hub allowing access to the nearby shielded moon. The exact timeframe of the station's period of use cannot be determined but is estimated at no less than several hundreds of thousands of years ago. \n\nThe company's employer appears to have been some kind of powerful religious organization that held significant influence in this region of space but seems to be gone by now. The exact significance of the [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] system is also unclear."
 mem_mountain.11.name: "The Holy Site"
 mem_mountain.11.desc: "Our expedition into the ring station came across a treasure trove of data that helped shed more light on the station's purpose. Most of it is lists of names and descriptions, accommodation requests and credentials. Millions of members of different species from countless worlds were visiting the system in the past, hoping to gain access to some kind of holy site protected by a powerful shield. \n\nNot everyone in the galaxy was happy with this, however. At some point the worshippers were targeted by a massive military campaign that besieged their worlds, including the [From.Planet.GetName] station. The end result of the conflict seems to have been mutual destruction. The personnel of the station was wiped out and never replaced, but some automatic systems remained functional even long after that and nobody has ever returned to turn them off."
 mem_mountain.12.name: "The Shield Generator"
 mem_mountain.12.desc: "We have located the source of shield generator inside [From.Planet.GetName]'s station. It is indeed powering the forcefield denying the access to the gas giant's moon to anyone who did not receive proper authorization. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! will now seek for a way to gain said authorization and bypass the shield."
 mem_mountain.13.name: "What Do Those Wires Do?"
 mem_mountain.13.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! wasn't able to crack the encryption codes that would allow our ships to bypass the shield surrounding §Y[shielded_moon.GetName]§!. Instead, [Leader.GetSheHe] resorted to simply removing wires from the shield generation in sequence until the force fiend ceased to exist. \n\nThe path is now open fot us to study the moon's surface and find out what about it was so important."
 mem_mountain.13.a: "Prepare to continue the excavations."
 
 mem_mountain.20.name: "The Pilgrimage"
 mem_mountain.20.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! has gained access to the inner structures of the mountain. The sprawling tunnel system seems to be designed to lead religious followers through some kind of spiritualist journey through endless halls dedicated to reflection, meditation and reading the uplifting slogans that were bolted to the walls. The true divine experience awaited them deep underground, but not everyone managed to make it there. \n\n[Leader.GetName] has detected some kind of energy field spreading through the complex, but its nature is unclear."
 mem_mountain.21.name: "The Wyrm Cult"
 mem_mountain.21.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! has finished surveying the underground passages and halls and is now ready to present the key findings regarding the nature of religion that centered on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. \n\nThe being worshipped by them went by many names, most prominently §SThe Wyrm§! and §SPale Wing§!, and is apparently residing at one of the lower levels of this very complex. The being is said to be ancient, wise and incredibly powerful. The chamber of the Wyrm is sealed more securely than the rest of the complex, so it would take considerable effort to breach it."
 mem_mountain.22.name: "The Wyrm Chained"
 mem_mountain.22.desc: "The expedition on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! reports successfully breaching the innermost chamber of the mountain complex. \n\nInside the spacious chamber they were met with a surprising sight - a massive living creature shackled to the cavern's walls. Is this §SThe Wyrm§! worshippers came to visit? \n\nIt seems the creature is trying to communicate with us."

 mem_mountain.23.name: "Pale Wing"
 mem_mountain.23.desc: "Ah, someone new... It's been a while. Have you come to slay me, set me free or just taunt? \n\nA machine beneath this hall is what is keeping me weak. Keeping me here. I can teach you to control it, I learned enough from watching my jailers to know how. Turn it up and I will die. Turn it off, and it will no longer keep me in this place, I could break right through the rock and to the surface. I only ask you to choose one. Release me."
 mem_mountain.23.a: "You are too dangerous to keep alive."
 mem_mountain.23.a.purifier: "We'll gladly put down an abomination like you."
 mem_mountain.23.b: "We'd rather keep you here."
 mem_mountain.23.b.response: "§R<<<Translation failure. Incoherent displeasure-associated noises>>>§!"
 mem_mountain.23.c: "We'll let you out."
 mem_mountain.23.c.response: "§gAs we shut down the machine, the dampening field dies down. The dragon looks relieved before snapping its chains and preparing to soar. It seems prudent to leave the immediate area now.§!"
 mem_mountain.23.d: "What are you and how did you get here?"
 mem_mountain.23.d.tooltip: "I have many names. Pale Wing is how my kin called me. Tiny ones like you called me differently. \n\nWe were once a numerous and proud species spread across the universe. But the universe changed. It became unfriendly to us. Most died and some adapted, but we will never be as powerful as we once were. \n\nI have lived a very long time, longer than I myself can remember. Most of my memories are now of this place. I've been trapped here for so long, I can't even remember how it started. \n\nThose who imprisoned me called me a god. But tell me, would you treat your god like this? What a joke. They travelled from afar seeking to placate me with offerings and validate their decisions. Their claims to power and importance. I would humour them sometimes, after all, what else could I do. \n\nThen they stopped. Now I am alone."
 mem_mountain.23.e: "Can we trust you with your freedom?"
 mem_mountain.23.e.tooltip: "No. How can you trust someone you just met? How can you trust someone so different from yourself? \n\nThere's nothing I can tell you that could convince you. No argument to be made. You'd have to take a risk and trust the word of a stranger."
 mem_mountain.23.f: "You really want us to kill you?"
 mem_mountain.23.f.tooltip: "Why not? I wish greatly to see the stars and fly through the endless expanse, hear the radiation and feel the solar wind on my skin. But most of all I want to no longer remain in this prison. \n\nKill me or release me. Either way, you will set me free."

 mem_mountain.24.name: "Death of a Dragon"
 mem_mountain.24.desc: "As the dragon described, we have located and powered up the dampening field generator. \n\nPale Wing roared one last time before expiring, its flesh disintegrating. \n\nThe remains of this once titanic creature are still available for study."
 mem_mountain.25.name: "Dragon's Ascent"
 mem_mountain.25.desc: "We are observing an astounding event on [the_planet.GetName]. As it claimed it could, Pale Wing has broken free of its shackles and soared right through the mountain into the sky, leaving behind nothing but rocky debris on its way to freedom. \n\nIt seems like it wishes to communicate again."

 mem_mountain.26.desc: "I am free! After all this time, I am free at last. You can't imagine how grateful I am to you for shutting down this infernal machine. \n\nThe universe seems different now. I don't even remember much of it. But I can't wait to re-discover those memories."
 mem_mountain.26.a: "Do you want to join us?"
 mem_mountain.26.a.response: "You would want this, don't you? To see your fleets heralded by a powerful being like me. \n\nI suppose I owe you. I don't have anywhere else to go. I must warn you that I am not as strong as my kind once was. I already see solar winds flowing over me and giving me strength... but it's a long process. Most of my wounds will heal relatively soon, but for me to truly regain my strength... I think your own civilisation will crumble and die out long before that. No offence."
 mem_mountain.26.b: "Suppose this is goodbye then."
 mem_mountain.26.b.resonse: "Farewell. I intend to share some of my wisdom with you, like I shared it with pilgrims back under the mountains. No offerings needed - that would steer painful memories."
 mem_mountain.26.c: "What do you intend to do now?"
 mem_mountain.26.c.response: "For a very long time, my entire world was a small cave. Now it grown so much bigger. \n\nI will need time, a lot of time, to move on. I intend to travel some place remote. Hopefully find peace. Preferably away from cultists of any kind."
 mem_mountain.26.d: "Those rocks looked quite heavy. Are you hurt?"
 mem_mountain.26.d.response: "I'm fine. Your concern is appreciated but misplaced. I may have grown weak in captivity, but I'm not that brittle."

 mem_mountain.41.name: "Dragon Slain"
 mem_mountain.41.desc: "We have emerged victorious from our recent encounter with a spaceborne creature. \n\nWe are unsure of its origin and nature, but its colossal remains could serve our science well."
 mem_mountain.42.name: "Pale Wing Killed"
 mem_mountain.42.desc: "It seems Pale Wing's freedom was short-lived. Our long-range tracking indicate that it was killed in [fromfromfrom.solar_system.GetName] system by the forces of the §Y[From.GetName]§!."
 mem_mountain.42.a: "A tragic loss."
 mem_mountain.44.desc: "I'm calling you one last time to say farewell. Now that I have regained enough strength, I do not see any reason to stay in the galaxy. \n\nI will journey outwards towards something new. It will take me a very long time to travel through the galactic void, but I'm used to solitude. \n\nGood luck."
 mem_mountain.44.a: "Farewell, Pale Wing."
 mem_mountain.46.name: "Pale Wing Slain"
 mem_mountain.46.desc: "We have destroyed Pale Wing. Even though we chose to give it freedom originally, it's now clear that it was a mistake to let such a creature to roam free. \n\nEven though some might call it betrayal, our reasoning is irrefutable."
 mem_mountain.46.a: "So be it."
