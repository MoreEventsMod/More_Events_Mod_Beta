 # Plants vs Zombies
 mem_plants_vs_zombies_site: "Ancient Battlefields"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies_site_desc: "[From.Planet.GetName], despite apparently never having supported life, is littered with battle sites. A closer investigation might shed some light on the cause of the fighting which took place here approximately five millenia ago."
 
 #Stage 1
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.1.name: "Lonely Fortresses"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.1.desc: "All battle sites are centered around heavily fortified positions which judging by all evidence were eventually overrun by their attackers. What is baffling, is, that neither of the investigated fortifications appear to have been of any kind of strategic importance or if they were, it is not apparent to us now.\n\nExcavations at various sites continue in order to reach their respective command structures which lie ruined and partially buried beneath rubble and sand."
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.1.a: "Go on."
 #Stage 2
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.2.name: "The Report"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.2.desc: "One of the excavation sites reports a major breakthrough. A partially intact datacore has been discovered in the ruined remains of a former command bunker. The majority of its content is corrupted, but one of the remaining files, the last report by the fort's commanding officer, provides us with deeper insight of what has happened there. The translated transcript reads as followed:\n\n§S23rd of the 1st Seed, Cycle 5376\nCommander Leafs of Autumn, 2nd Expeditionary Corps, stationed at Fortress F27, Daruban Wasteland Sector C5\nFertilizer's attacks grow ever stronger. While early waves were easy pickings, enemy numbers grow exponentionally. No idea what keeps them going either. Seen lots of humanoids before, but none were as resilient and as lacking in selfpreservation. One got ripped in half by a mortar shell and still kept crawling to our lines until it received a hit to its sensory appendage. Instructed all personnel to target that area since.\nTime between assaults varies between minutes and weeks, no apparent pattern to it.\nSupplies are stable and expected to last until the next scheduled drop.\nKeeping communication silence as per our client's order.\n>> recording stops and restarts <<\nScouts just reported another incoming wave of fertilizer. Bigger than anything we've seen so far... Chances for victory appear slim, but by my honor, our orders are to hold this rock and this is what we'll do, to the last plant if necessary.§!\n\nAccording to this report the military force defending the strongholds were contracted plantoid mercenaries. Still, the reason of their presense continues to elude us."
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.2.a: "Fertilizer?"
 #Stage 3
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.3.name: "Paradox Records"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.3.desc: "Further excavations at different fortifications have left our expedition with more questions than answers. According to the recovered files found in various command bunkers each end every one of them had been under the direct command of commander Leafs of Autumn, though each time under a different military designation.\n\n[leader.GetName] is unsure what to make of all this as contradictions are mounting. Apparently personal entries collected cover a time span of over 50 years. From multiple assignments at the same time over the repeating claim of the current assignment being the first on this planet to the fact that each ultimately ended in a last stand and subsequent destruction of each stronghold by the same foe - no coherent picture seems to form.\n\nAs investigations have run into a dead end, [leader.GetName] suggests to shift focus on what the defensive structures might have protected. Another planetary scan might provide a new approach to solving this mystery."
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.3.a: "Make it so."
 #Stage 4
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.4.name: "Noone Home"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.4.desc: "A more thorough and time-consuming scan of the planet's surface has revealed a well hidden subterranean bunker complex.\n\nUpon opening the sealed entrance the expedition team is greeted by mostly empty rooms and corridors. It appears as if whoever used this place, left in an orderly manner after its operation ceased. The only remaining technology is integrated into the bunker's structure in a way that apparently prohibited its removal. Among it is the structure's main computer system, though all memory banks have been wiped. Despite this with enough time and effort, fragments of the data originally contained within them might be restored.\n\nFrom what we have learned so far, it is assumed, this bunker was some kind of monitoring station. A theory supported by the discovery of subsurface cables connecting this facility to vantage points near each and every known battlesite."
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.4.a: "Continue."
 #Stage 5
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.5.name: "Clones"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.5.desc: "Restoring the memory banks prooved less difficult than first expected. It appears the former owners only half-heartedly wiped them, but given that the restored data is mostly encrypted they apparently weren't very concerned either way.\n\nHowever, our decryption specialists have already begun their work. The first batch of decrypted files reveals that this base's operators maintained frequent communication with atleast two seperate factions, one of which turned out to be the plantoid mercenary headquarter. What came as a revelation to our scientists in regards to our earlier findings, is that according to the logs, the mercenaries were contractors specialised in providing clone armies and hired to garrison fortresses across the planet.\n\nThe other contact has not yet been identified, but appears to have been active on the planet as well. Communication logs suggest both they and the mercenaries were involved in a longterm operation."
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.5.a: "Go on."
 #Stage 6
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.6.name: "Plantoids VS Necroids"
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.6.desc: "Our decryption team reports a breakthrough. The previously unidentified contact was a militant religious order of necromancers calling themselves the Necromages of Aramen. Communications with these necroids mainly revolved around when and where to send their undead hordes, as well es shipments of deceased slaves to replenesh them with.\n\n[leader.GetName] is unsure what to make of this orchestrated "war" as both factions acted on behest of the same client. But internal memos between the base's personel show, neither were they. As it turns out they were nothing more than mediators themselves and their client remained as nebulous even to them as it does to us. Their speculations ranged from this whole operation being a noble man's game all the way to secret military studies.\n\nWhatever the truth is, the recovered data of countless battles fought on this world will surely help to improve our own military doctrines."
 mem_plants_vs_zombies.6.a: "A game, huh?"
