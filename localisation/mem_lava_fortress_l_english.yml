 #First Anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress_category:0 "Inside the Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress_category_desc:0 "Deep scans indicate an unusual shape on the surface, indicating a possible artificial structure."
 #Second Anomaly (Loop)
 mem_lava_fortress_loop_category:0 "Lava Fortress"
 mem_lava_fortress_loop_category_desc:0 "This ancient complex is still a mystery to us. We have to lift its secrets..."
 
 #simple fail - thats it
 mem_lava_fortress.1.name:0 "Just Hot Air"
 mem_lava_fortress.1.desc:0 "It appears the strange shape was just a plateau with heat and uneven density of magma distorting the results. Nothing artificial was found at the site."
 mem_lava_fortress.1.a:0 "Go on."
 
 #hard fail - start the loop
 mem_lava_fortress.2.name:0 "Danger Room"
 mem_lava_fortress.2.desc:0 "Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin. Looking further into the complex [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] wandered into what [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall. Unwittingly activating a lever in the room caused multiple spikes to quickly emerge and retract from the floor, apparently set to train users in dodging techniques.\n\nBy the look of it, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] and most of [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were mediocre dodgers at best..."
 mem_lava_fortress.2.a:0 "Send in a second team. This is not over!"
 mem_lava_fortress.2.b:0 "This complex is a death trap! We should seal it off!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.3.name:0 "A Death in Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress.3.desc:0 "The research team successfully located an abandoned complex on the planet's surface. However, when exploring its vestibule, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] appears to have stepped on a pressure plate of a sort, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling filling the entire complex. Both the fortress and our science team are lost."
 mem_lava_fortress.3.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.4.name:0 "A Colossal Cave-in"
 mem_lava_fortress.4.desc:0 "The strange shape turned out to be an alien outpost of a sort. However, after choosing to explore the interiors, [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] unwittingly pulled a lever seated in one of the rooms, causing the apparently sole support column to suddenly snap, resulting in a cave-in and the total destruction of the entire complex."
 mem_lava_fortress.4.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #hard fail - continues the loop
 mem_lava_fortress.5.name:0 "More Traps"
 mem_lava_fortress.5.desc:0 "Another science team has successfully entered the complex. Despite their best efforts to not pull any dangerous levers resulting in "unpleasentries", [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetName] apparently unwittingly stepped onto a pressure plate of a sort, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling filling the room [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetSheHe] and [mem_lava_fortress_leader.GetHisHer] team were in."
 mem_lava_fortress.5.a:0 "Send another team. We won't give up!"
 mem_lava_fortress.5.b:0 "This complex is a death trap! We should seal it off!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.6.name:0 "A Death in Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress.6.desc:0 "The research team successfully got into the fortress.

 #Success in first try
 mem_lava_fortress.10.name:0 "Lava Fortress"
 mem_lava_fortress.10.desc:0 "Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, sturdily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin. From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects a big part of their history could be reconstructed. The facility was established in this harsh conditions under the belief that that deep underneath they could find a vein or two of a rare - and to them incredibly valuable - ore.\n\nBy pumping magma to the surface they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defense system relying on multiple lava floodable areas, as well as finding a means to dispose of "undesirables" - as shown on an extensive amount of reliefs.\n\nAt first, the outpost had grown steadily and its prosperity had attracted many newcomers. Many inhabitants did not only work in the mines but had also turned to fine arts, creating objects intricately decorated with fractal images of themselves and other weird yet beautiful creations.\n\nDespite being constantly besieged by nebulous rivals, the colony endured for multiple generations. But as the dig to the planetary core drew near conclusion, a catastrophic event from inside the community must have happened. Judging from their statable injuries and as there are only remains of this one alien species the implication of a devastating civil war arises. As their storage was filled which all kinds of goods and equipment our science team doubts that a resource shortage could have been the cause of the crisis. Though to the amusement of the others one of our scientists pointed out there wasn't any kind of protective foot gear despite the fact that most of the reliefs found emphasize it as a sign of social standing. Unfortunately our team was unable to find out any more details."
 mem_lava_fortress.10.a:0 "Truly, all xenos are mad..."
 mem_lava_fortress.10.b:0 "Such a unique and amazing species..."
 mem_lava_fortress.10.c:0 "Do WE have enough boots?!"
