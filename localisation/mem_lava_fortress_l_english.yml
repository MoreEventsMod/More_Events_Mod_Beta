 #First Anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress_category:0 "Inside the Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress_category_desc:0 "Deep scans indicate an unusual shape on the surface, indicating a possible artificial structure."
 #Second Anomaly (Loop)
 mem_lava_fortress_loop_category:0 "Lava Fortress"
 mem_lava_fortress_loop_category_desc:0 "This ancient complex is still a mystery to us. We have to lift its secrets..."
 
 #simple fail - thats it
 mem_lava_fortress.1.name:0 "Just Hot Air"
 mem_lava_fortress.1.desc:0 "It appears the strange shape was just a plateau with heat and uneven density of magma distorting the results. Nothing artificial was found at the site."
 mem_lava_fortress.1.a:0 "Go on."
 
 #hard fail - start the loop
 mem_lava_fortress.2.name:0 "Danger Room"
 mem_lava_fortress.2.desc:0 "Our archaeology team successfully used heat-resistant equipment to dig deep into the alien outpost. They found multiple remains of short, strudily-built aliens of apparently mammalian origin. Looking further into the complex [Root.GetLeadername] wandered into what [Root.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall. Unwittingly activating a lever in the room caused multiple spikes to quickly emerge and retract from the floor, apparently set to train users in dodging techniques.\n\nBy the look of it, [Root.GetLeadername] and most of [Root.GetHisHer] team were mediocre dodgers at best..."
 mem_lava_fortress.2.a:0 "Send in a second team. This is not over!"
 mem_lava_fortress.2.b:0 "This complex is a death trap! We should seal it off!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.3.name:0 "A Death in Fire"
 mem_lava_fortress.3.desc:0 "The research team successfully located an abandoned complex on the planet's surface. However, when exploring its vestibule, [Root.GetLeadername] appears to have stepped on a pressure plate of a sort, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling filling the entire complex. Both the fortress and our science team are lost."
 mem_lava_fortress.3.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #hard fail - ends the anomaly
 mem_lava_fortress.4.name:0 "A Colossal Cave-in"
 mem_lava_fortress.4.desc:0 "The strange shape turned out to be an alien outpost of a sort. However, after choosing to explore the interiors, [Root.GetLeadername] unwittingly pulled a lever seated in one of the rooms, causing the apparently sole support column to suddenly snap, resulting in a cave-in and the total destruction of the entire complex."
 mem_lava_fortress.4.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 
 #hard fail - continues the loop
 mem_lava_fortress.5.name:0 "More Traps"
 mem_lava_fortress.5.desc:0 "Another science team has successfully entered the complex. Despite their best efforts to not pull any dangerous levers resulting in "unpleasentries", [Root.GetLeadername] apparently unwittingly stepped onto a pressure plate of a sort, somehow causing a stream of lava from outside to pour from the ceiling filling the room [Root.GetSheHe] and [Root.GetHisHer] team were in."
 mem_lava_fortress.5.a:0 "Send another team. We won't give up!"
 mem_lava_fortress.5.b:0 "This complex is a death trap! We should seal it off!"
