 # Warning message
 mem_version_check.2.name:0 "Notification"
 mem_version_check.2.desc:0 "This message appears because More Events Mod has been either activated in a running game or has been updated after this game has been started.\n\nIn case this mod was activated in an ongoing game, it will not cause any problems, but some features will only be available in a newly started game.\n\nIn case this game was started with MEM already active, this means there has been an update in the meantime. It might not necessarily cause problems, but as always updates might at a chance break old savegames. If you encounter problems, please confirm that they also appear in a newly started game before reporting them as bugs. They may very well result from version incompatibilities caused by the old savegame.\n\nThis warning message won't appear again in this playthrough. We hope you enjoy our mod!"
