Be sure to check out the issue tracker and the wiki on the main
repository; both are helpful.

If you have completed and tested a feature, you may submit it to `dev`
to be tested by the rest of the team. Please tag @Tester on discord to
let the testing team know it is ready for testing, and add an issue to
the tracker asking for testing and saying how to test your feature.
For features that are incomplete, partial, or untested, please create
a new branch. It is recommended that you branch from `master`.
