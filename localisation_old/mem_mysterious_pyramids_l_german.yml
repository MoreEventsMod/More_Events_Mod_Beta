 #mem_mysterious_pyramids_category_desc:0 "Survey of this toxic world has identified over a dozen pyramidal shapes spaced with geometric precision across the surface. Considering this world is uninhabitable to intelligent life as we know it, this could be worth investigation."
 mem_mysterious_pyramids_category_desc:0 "Eine Vermessung dieser toxischen Welt hat ergeben, dass ein über Dutzend pyramidenförmige Objekte mit unglaublicher Präzision und gleichen Abstand über der Oberfläche verteilt sind. In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass diese Welt unbewohnbar ist für intelligentes Leben das wir kennen, könnte eine Untersuchung durchaus Wert sein."

 #mem_mysterious_pyramids.102.desc:0 "As hypothesized, the pyramidal structures are artificial. The walls are made of locally sourced cemented aggregates, and a deeper analysis has picked up decaying radioactives consistent with fission reactors. Several have been spotted releasing large, gaseous plumes. Spectroscopic analysis indicates these are mostly comprised of water vapour and carbon dioxide, with a not unsubstantial quantity of methane as well.\n\nScience Officer [This.GetLeaderName] believes the pyramids to be outgassing stations erected to terraform the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide are both conducive to life. Along the way, these stations must have tapped into a buried reserve of methane hydrate, also known as fire ice. This release could have caused the runaway greenhouse effect that currently rules atmospheric chemistry of this world. Acidic rainstorms rake the surface, eating away at the terraformers. It's only a matter of time before they break down, but the damage has al#ready been done. Analysis of what happened will help us to avoid these pitfalls in the future."
 mem_mysterious_pyramids.102.desc:0 "Wie vermutet, sind die Pyramiden künstlicher Natur. Die Wände wurden aus Zement hergestellt, dessen Materialien sie aus der näheren Umgebung herstellten. Eine tiefere Analyse zeigte eine bereits zerfallene radioaktive Eigenschaft, ähnlich wie bei einer Kernspaltung."

 mem_mysterious_pyramids.103.desc:0 "Analysis of the pyramid structures has discovered that they are indeed of artificial construction. Thousands of hexapod robots skitter across of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, responsible for the infrastructure and resource extraction installations detected on orbital photography. The pyramids themselves function like atmospheric processors, but at first glance do not appear to be affecting the mix in the atmosphere at all.\n\nA startling revelation came to Science Officer [This.GetLeaderName]. Perhaps these constructs are performing as programmed. The pyramids may have been built to generate this toxic atmosphere, then maintain it as it appears to be doing now. Science Officer [This.GetLeaderName] posits the theory that this world was visited by a ship or probe programmed to alter this world to one that could accommodate a race vastly dissimilar to us. The corrosive tempests that sweep this world's equatorial region could be little more than a breeze to them, the lakes of ammonia there to support their version of agriculture.\n\nAnother possibility presents itself: there could be other probes out there, sent to find more worlds to 'xenoform' into toxic wastelands."

 mem_mysterious_pyramids.202.name:0 "It Is A Mystery"
 mem_mysterious_pyramids.202.desc:0 "The pyramids are large stone structures with enough complexity to make artificial construction a likely answer. Remote excavation has provided few answers. They are constructed of simple granite, with no interior mechanism or signs of engineering any more complex than an earthmover. Perhaps they are cultural artifacts of some kind: markers for the dead, or parts of an astronomical calendar. Whatever they are, these oddities are of no use to us."
