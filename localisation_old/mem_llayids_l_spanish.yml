However, it is not clear what caused this event, as the material remains match none with which we are familiar. [root.leader.GetName] has recommended we establish a research post to study the former inhabitants and what caused their demise. Could it have been a superweapon, the likes of which we can scarcely imagine?"

They have an unusual trinary body structure - standing upright on three legs as on a tripod, they sprout two sets of three arms - each arm with three fingers - as well as a full three heads! Each head has one eye, one ear and two mouths - presumably one to speak and one to eat. It is unfortunate that we have been unable to find any organic remains of the Llayids - their biology must have been a true marvel!\n\nNear this depiction, our researcher also found examples of what is believed to be Llayid script. However, attempts to translate it have so far proved futile."

Each head has one eye, one ear and two mouths - presumably one to speak and one to eat. It is unfortunate that we have been unable to find any organic remains of the Llayids - it would be interesting to see how such an inefficient body structure could possibly have worked.\n\nNear this depiction, our seeker drone also found examples of what is believed to be Llayid script.

 mem_llayids.8.desc:0 "The mystery surrounding the demise of the Llayids deepens. Although our team has been unable to find any evidence as to what caused the destruction of their habitats, they have catalogued a large number of items, ranging from fragments of small space craft to entire buildings to all manner of everyday objects. Unfortunately, it appears that their electronic systems were not of a very sturdy design, so very few have survived the past few thousand years.\n\nHowever, what has surprised our researchers is that not a single object has however been identified as a weapon. This has led our scientists to theorise that the Llayids were an entirely pacifistic species. Who or what could have wanted their destruction?"

 mem_llayids.15.desc:0 "Our [root.owner.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] have managed to decipher a key entry in the data cores. In it, the Llayid habitats are still whole. Hundreds of them of various sizes can be seen orbiting the gas giant, which does not have a ring in the pictures.\n\nThe Llayids in the pictures appear to be attending a public ceremony: A large crowd of them are in a public arena, staring at a screen from which two Llayids are talking. Although it is difficult for us to read Llayid emotions, they appear calm, even upbeat.\n\n"This is it," one of the Llayids is saying. "We have discovered what we came here for. We have found out the meaning of life and death itself. We know now who we are, where we come from, and where we are going."\n\nThe other Llayid spreads its arms. "We may depart now in peace," it says. "The Beyond has no hold over us anymore."\n\nThe Llayids in the arena cheer and appear to be celebrating as the habitat suddenly detonates. No sign of panic can be seen before the recording cuts off - rather, the Llayids show a strange mixture of serenity and ecstasy.\n\nWe can only assume that the Llayids believed - rightly or wrongly - that they had uncovered secrets of their life and afterlife that sufficiently shook the foundation of their society that they came to the collective decision that there was no further point to them living and they should expedite the conclusion of their life cycle.\n\nThe cores contain much further data, and many remnants in the debris field have not yet been catalogued, meaning that this site will provide us with further insights into the Llayids' curious civilisation and its achievements for years to come."
