 #Events
 mem_rubicon.1.name:0 "Rubicon System"
 mem_rubicon.1.desc:0 "We have discovered a large number of unfriendly vessels of unusual design patrolling the §Y[From.GetName]§! System, which is filled with old battle debris. \n\nProvisionarily named "§YRubiconids§!", they appear to be primarily concentrated around a dense asteroid belt as if they are protecting something."
 mem_rubicon.1.a:0 "We should monitor the situation."

 mem_rubicon_core_category:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon_core_category_desc:0 "A profile of a large inert vessel can be detected deep within the dense field of debris."

 mem_rubicon.2.name:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon.2.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] [Leader.GetHasHave] confirmed the presence of an unknown vessel inside the densest part of the planetary debris field. \n\nPreliminary observations suggest that it is parked next to a large rock and is safe for now, but due to the hazardous environment, it would be impossible to safely manoeuvre it out."
 mem_rubicon.2.a:0 "We should keep monitoring it."
 mem_rubicon.2.a.tooltip:0 "Adds §S$mem_rubicon_hidden_ship$§! to §Y[From.GetName]§!: \n£engineering  Engineering §G+6§!. \nBuild a §Sresearch station§! over it to find out more."

 mem_rubicon_hidden_ship:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon_hidden_ship_desc:0 "A ship is hidden deep within the thick debris. \n\n§LBuild a §Sresearch station§L over it to find out more.§!"

 mem_rubicon.4.name:0 "Window of Opportunity"
 mem_rubicon.4.desc:0 "After observing §Y[From.GetName]§! for a while, our scientists have formulated a plan to navigate the dense debris field and access the hidden ship. \n\nThis will be risky, but preliminary reports suggest that highly advanced technology is hidden there."
 mem_rubicon.4.a:0 "Make it happen."

 MEM_RUBICON_EXPEDITION:0 "Concealed Ship"
 MEM_RUBICON_EXPEDITION_DESC:0 "A ship is hidden deep within the debris field designated §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§!. With precise timing and agile navigation, we should be able to reach it."

 mem_rubicon.5.name:0 "The Worldmender"
 mem_rubicon.5.desc:0 "Scientist [Leader.GetName] aboard the [Root.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetHerHis] team has successfully navigated the dense debris field in the §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! System and boarded the inert ship concealed in the midst of it. \n\nSaid ship is impressively old, with estimates ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Most of equipment and data cores aboard have been lost to age and debris impacts. However, what we managed to gather is still quite fascinating. It appears that the vessel is a warship-terraformer hybrid called a Worldmender. Originally carrying a massive crew and a large number of passengers, it is currently conserved under the supervision of an AI unit called a "Fleetmind". \n\nThe whole Worldmender is too damaged to escape, but parts of it might, with our help."
 mem_rubicon.5.a:0 "Save the essential warship modules."
 mem_rubicon.5.a.tooltip:0 "A powerful new ship will be added to our navy, along with an §Sadmiral AI§!. \nAs long as the ship is in our possession, we will enjoy the benefits of the §Y$mem_rubicon_mender_archives$§!"
 mem_rubicon.5.b:0 "Save the warship modules but wipe out the AI"
 mem_rubicon.5.b.tooltip:0 "A powerful new ship will be added to our navy. \nAs long as the ship is in our possession, we will enjoy the benefits of the §Y$mem_rubicon_mender_archives$§!"
 mem_rubicon.5.c:0 "Reactivate the terraforming systems."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip:0 "If we reactivate the system, the ship will be lost to us. It will be used to mend the debris field into an actual planet."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.gaia:0 "A §GGaia§! world will be produced."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.regular:0 "A §SRegular§! world will be produced."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.tomb:0 "A §LTomb§! world will be produced."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.barren:0 "A §RBarren§! world will be produced."
 mem_rubicon.5.d:0 "Access data on the ship's creators."
 mem_rubicon.5.d.response:0 "The ship belonged to a civilisation identified simply as the §SMenders§!. The core tenet of their ideology seems to have been a sense of "ecological supremacy", that is, they believed the natural ecosystem of their homeworld to be superior to any other ecosystem in the galaxy. For generations, they practiced aggressive terraforming with wanton disregard for native life forms, often breaking down entire planets' biospheres and reforging them anew. At times, they would even take apart planets and reconstruct them to suit their ideal using fleets led by so-called Worldmender ships."
 mem_rubicon.5.e:0 "Find out more on what caused their downfall."
 mem_rubicon.5.e.response:0 "The information on the Menders' political affiliations is scarce, but the history of their downfall seems clear. \n\nOne of the civilisations that found itself caught in the wake of the Menders' terraforming spree had apparently relied on a network of heavily automated hidden shipyards, and although their worlds were quickly transformed into gardens of the Menders' design, several such shipyards remained. \n\nA century or so after their masters' extinction, hordes of drones appeared at the borders of the overstretched and complacent Mender Empire, overwhelming their fleets with sheer numbers. The Menders who once wiped out their creators found themselves at mercy of the drones and were soon forced to retreat to a hidden base. Despite their best efforts, the enemy followed them and destroyed the reminder of their armada."
 mem_rubicon.5.f:0 "Access final reports."
 mem_rubicon.5.f.response:0 "Here, in the [mem_rubicon_core_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System, the Menders made their last stand against the machines hell-bent on their destruction. Once the site of a promising terraforming project, it had become the place where they would meet their end.\n\n As defeat seemed inevitable, the badly damaged flagship dove into the half-formed shell of a planet and remained hidden, operated and maintained by its caretaker AI. Unable to pursue it, the drones kept vigil in the system. In time, it seems, the surviving drones were designated §SRubiconids§! by galactic explorers who were unaware of their true goals."

 mem_rubicon_mender_archives:0 "Menders' Archives"
 mem_rubicon_mender_archives_desc:0 "The Worldmender databases contain an immense amount of terraforming know-hows that we are still unable to move off-site. \n§TWe must not lose this ship if we are to keep these benefits.§!"

 mem_trait_rubicon_mender:0 "Mender Mind"
 mem_trait_rubicon_mender_desc:0 "This AI construct was designed to both lead the Mender fleet into battle and see it through rebuilding another world in their image. Nowadays it has been repurposed to lead a different fleet."

 mem_rubicon.6.name:0 "Planet Mending Successful"
 mem_rubicon.6.desc:0 "§Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! has been successfully transformed into a Gaia world. \n\nThe Menders' dream of a promised land lives on, thousands of years after their extinction."

 mem_rubicon.7.name:0 "Planet Mending Complete"
 mem_rubicon.7.desc:0 "It seems that the damage sustained by the terraforming equipment was too severe to fully realise its potential, but still, §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! has successfully been transformed into a habitable world. \n\nThe Menders' dream of a promised land lives on, even if a bit tarnished, thousands of years after their extinction."
 mem_rubicon.7.a:0 "Could've been better."

 mem_rubicon.8.name:0 "Flawed Planet Mending"
 mem_rubicon.8.desc:0 "It seems that the damage sustained by the terraforming equipment was too severe. §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! has been successfully transformed into a habitable world, but massive radiation leaks have kept it from being properly habitable. \n\nThe Menders' dream of a promised land has not been fully realized."
 mem_rubicon.8.a:0 "At least it holds together."

 mem_rubicon.9.name:0 "Planet Mending Failed"
 mem_rubicon.9.desc:0 "It seems that the damage sustained by the terraforming equipment was too severe. §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! has been fused together, but all the systems that were supposed to make this massive rock habitable did not produce the intended results. \n\nThe Menders' dream of a promised land has utterly failed."
 mem_rubicon.9.a:0 "Most disappointing."

 mem_rubicon_mended_ecosystem:0 "Mender Ecosystem"
 mem_rubicon_mended_ecosystem_desc:0 "The ecosystem here is built from the ground up, following the blueprints of the long-gone "Planetmenders". Everything is in perfect balance."

 mem_rubicon_country_buff:0 "Rubiconids"
