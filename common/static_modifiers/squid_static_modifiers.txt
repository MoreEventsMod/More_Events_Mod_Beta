# The below should add modifiers for a booming or busted economy.
# From the 00_static_modifiers file, it seems pretty much anything there can be aped and added as another modifier here. More can (and should) be added down the line. We can use generic modifiers instead of one unique per event, but note that these won't stack, most likely.
