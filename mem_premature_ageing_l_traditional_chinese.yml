 mem_premature_ageing_category_desc:0 "[From.GetName]的質量、能源輸出和光譜圖樣，都比同類及同齡的星體有著很大的差異，暗示它有加速老化的可能性。"
 
 mem_premature_ageing.1.name:0 "失敗"
 mem_premature_ageing.1.desc:0 "毋庸置疑地，這顆星體比我們預料中老化得更快，更會在二百萬年內轉化為超新星───比平常的快了至少二十億年。可是，我們無法判斷這奇怪現象的因由。"
 mem_premature_ageing.1.a:0 "太可惜了。"
 
 mem_premature_ageing.2.name:0 "Solar Extinguisher"
 mem_premature_ageing.2.desc:0 "從長期休眠的能量痕跡及靠近星體日冕的突破點得知，[From.GetName]的加速老化是人為做成的。看起來在數百萬年前，一條射線從某個遙遠的星系，利用我們難以理解的科技發出，擊中這個星體。\n\n這可能是一種武器，或是一次極具規模的民間工程。它把星體的核心完全穿透了，弄翻了內部的核聚變過程，希望將它提早變成超新星。不幸中之大幸的是，這項工程未能成功達到如此毀滅性的目標，不過在二百萬年前的旁觀者肯定充分感受到射線的威力。"
 mem_premature_ageing.2.normal:0 "It's a shame we can't trace the weapon's origin point."
 mem_premature_ageing.2.alternate:0 "We should be able to trace the weapon's origin point."
 
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_TRACING_PROJECT:0 "Trace the Solar Extinguisher"
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_TRACING_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Powerful weapon ripped through time-space continuum and transported enormous amount of energy at faster-than-light speed. Even millions of years later, the subspace breach points are lingering near the star and with some skill we should be able to trace their origin point."
 
 mem_premature_ageing.3.name:0 "Origin Point Found"
 mem_premature_ageing.3.desc:0 "We're in luck! Methods that are normally useless in tracing usual subspace activity have proven to be useful for this particular occasion due to enormous amount of energy that was passing through once. We had pinpointed origin point of this energy transfer to a remote system."
 
 #Event chain
 mem_premature_ageing_chain_title:0 "Find the Weapon's Origin Point"
 mem_premature_ageing_chain_desc:0 "We should try to find the weapon's origin point. From there, we might be able to learn more on the technology that was used to aged this star so quickly."
 mem_premature_ageing_asteroid_checked:0 "Origin Point Found"
 
 #Point of Interest
 mem_premature_ageing_weapon_origin.1.name:0 "Weapon's Origin Point"
 mem_premature_ageing_weapon_origin.1.desc:0 "Location from where the weapon was supposedly fired."
 
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_ANALYZE_PROJECT:0 "Examine the Asteroid"
 MEM_PREMATURE_AGEING_WEAPON_ANALYZE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "We were able to locate residue breach point near the system's asteroid belt. If we didn't know what to look for, we wouldn't even notice it, but now it might be just the place to look for the solar extinguisher we are trying to find."
 
 mem_premature_ageing.5.name:0 "Solar Extinguisher"
 mem_premature_ageing.5.desc:0 "For the uninitiated, it might look like just an ordinary space rock. But we know better. With our scanners uniquely calibrated we can see that this asteroid was once a part of an extremely advanced power transference system. What seems like simple metal deposits to others, is actually advanced circuitry that was once running within some planet's crust.\n\nIt appears first use of the extremely powerful weapon was its last - massive energy overload tore the planet housing it apart turning it into an asteroid belt we know now. The ancient technology hidden inside is millennia ahead of us, but even in this state, mapping out power distribution circuitry is offering us an invaluable insight into energy weapon technology."
 
 mem_premature_ageing_solar_extinguisher_tech:0 "Solar Extinguisher Technology"
 mem_premature_ageing_solar_extinguisher_tech_desc:0 "With the study of this technology, we have been able to fine tune our energy weapon so that they could deal more damages with better efficiency."
